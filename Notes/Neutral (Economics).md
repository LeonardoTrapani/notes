# Neutral (Economics)

## Definition
A **neutral** is a commodity which **does not change utility** with additional consumption.

## Mathematical Condition
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = 0$$

The [[Marginal Utility]] is zero - additional units neither increase nor decrease total utility.

## Characteristics
- **Zero marginal utility**: Additional consumption has no effect on satisfaction
- **Consumer is indifferent**: No preference for more or less of the neutral
- **Horizontal or vertical indifference curves**: Depending on which good is neutral
- **Violates [[Monotonicity Axiom]]**: "More is better" does not apply

## Economic Examples
- **Worthless objects**: Items with no functional or aesthetic value
- **Beyond satiation point**: Additional units of any good after complete satisfaction
- **Irrelevant attributes**: Characteristics consumers don't care about
- **Obsolete goods**: Items no longer needed or wanted

## Utility Function Implications
For a neutral $n$ in a utility function $U(x, n)$:
- **Marginal utility is zero**: $MU_n = 0$
- **Utility unchanged by consumption**: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial n} = 0$
- **Only other goods matter**: $U(x,n) = f(x)$

## Indifference Curve Properties
When one commodity is neutral:
- **Horizontal curves**: If good on y-axis is neutral
- **Vertical curves**: If good on x-axis is neutral
- **Parallel lines**: Consumer cares only about the non-neutral good
- **No curvature**: No trade-offs involving the neutral

## Market Behavior
- **Zero price**: No one will pay for neutrals
- **No demand**: Quantity demanded independent of income/prices
- **No market exists**: Economic activity doesn't develop around neutrals
- **Storage costs matter**: May pay to dispose of neutrals

## Consumer Choice Implications

### Optimization
- **Corner solutions**: Consumer chooses based only on non-neutral goods
- **Budget constraint simplifies**: Only non-neutral goods affect spending
- **Demand functions**: Neutral goods have zero demand regardless of price

### Welfare Analysis
- **No consumer surplus**: Neutrals provide no welfare benefit
- **No loss from removal**: Taking away neutrals doesn't reduce utility
- **Policy irrelevant**: Government intervention has no welfare effects

## Examples in Different Contexts

### Satiation Examples
- **Water consumption**: Beyond physiological needs, additional water may be neutral
- **Salt**: After optimal seasoning, more salt provides no benefit
- **Information**: Additional irrelevant information may be neutral

### Technological Examples
- **Obsolete features**: VHS players in the streaming era
- **Unnecessary complexity**: Features consumers don't use or value
- **Redundant products**: Multiple identical items when one suffices

### Aesthetic Examples
- **Personal taste**: Art styles that evoke no emotional response
- **Fashion**: Trends that some consumers find irrelevant
- **Colors**: Specific shades that don't affect preferences

## Policy Implications
- **No regulation needed**: Markets ignore neutrals naturally
- **No taxation effects**: Cannot raise revenue from neutrals
- **Resource allocation**: Should not waste resources on neutrals
- **Innovation focus**: R&D should avoid neutral attributes

## Relationship to Other Classifications

### vs. [[Good (Economics)|Goods]]
- **Neutrals**: Zero marginal utility, no economic value
- **Goods**: Positive marginal utility, consumers seek more

### vs. [[Bad (Economics)|Bads]]
- **Neutrals**: Zero marginal utility, consumers indifferent
- **Bads**: Negative marginal utility, consumers avoid

## Theoretical Importance
Neutrals help explain:
- **Market failures**: Why some markets don't exist
- **Consumer behavior**: Focus on goods that matter
- **Product design**: Avoiding irrelevant features
- **Welfare economics**: Complete utility characterization

## Mathematical Example
Consider utility function:
$$U(x,n) = \ln(x)$$

Here:
- $x$ is a good: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{x} > 0$
- $n$ is neutral: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial n} = 0$

Consumer cares only about $x$ consumption.

## Transition Between Classifications
A commodity can transition:
- **Good to neutral**: At satiation point
- **Neutral to bad**: If forced consumption beyond indifference
- **Context-dependent**: Same item different across consumers
