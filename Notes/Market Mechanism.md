## Definition
The **market mechanism** is the system through which goods and services are allocated in market economies. It operates through the interaction of supply and demand forces.

## Core Components

### Two Sides of Markets
- **Demand**: Represents buyers' willingness to purchase
- **Supply**: Represents sellers' willingness to provide

### Price Function
When markets function properly, **prices measure scarcity** of goods and services that are exchanged. This creates a critical information system where:
- Prices convey information to both buyers and sellers
- Economic actors make decisions based on price signals and other variables
- Resource allocation occurs through price mechanisms

## Economic Significance
The market mechanism serves as an information processing system that:
1. Signals relative scarcity of resources
2. Coordinates economic decisions across multiple agents
3. Facilitates efficient allocation of goods and services
