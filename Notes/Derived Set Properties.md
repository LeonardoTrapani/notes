The **derived set** $A'$ contains all [[Accumulation Points]] of $A$.

### Key Properties
- [[Isolated Points]] are not in the derived set: $35 \notin A'$ 
- [[Boundary Points]] that are also [[Accumulation Points]] are in $A'$
- [[Interior Points]] are always accumulation points, so they're in $A'$

### Example
For the set $A = (-\infty, 2) \cup [5, 7] \cup (10, 30) \cup \{35\}$:

$$A' = (-\infty, 2] \cup [5, 7] \cup [10, 30]$$

Notice that:
- The isolated point $35 \notin A'$ (not an accumulation point)
- The boundary points that are also accumulation points are in $A'$
- Interior points are always accumulation points

### Notation
Using [[Standard Set Notations]], the derived set is denoted as $A'$.
