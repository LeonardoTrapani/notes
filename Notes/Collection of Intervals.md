For a collection of intervals $\{A_m\}_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ where $A_m = (-\frac{1}{m}, \frac{1}{m})$:

### Intersection Properties
The intersection $A = \bigcap_{m} A_m$ represents the common elements in all intervals.

When $A_1 \supset A_2 \supset A_3 \supset \ldots$ (nested intervals), the intersection may be:
- A single point: $A = \{0\}$
- An interval: $A = [0,0]$
- The empty set if there's no common element

### Example Case
In the case of $A_m = (-\frac{1}{m}, \frac{1}{m})$:
- $\inf A = \min A = \sup A = \max A = 0$
- This demonstrates properties of [[Infimum and Supremum]]
- The result is a [[Bounded Sets|bounded set]]
