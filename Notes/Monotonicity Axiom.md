# Monotonicity Axiom

## Definition
The monotonicity axiom states that "more is better" - if one bundle contains at least as much of every good and strictly more of at least one good, then it is strictly preferred.

**Formal Statement**: 
- If $x_1^b \geq x_1^a$ and $x_2^b > x_2^a$, then $b \succ a$
- If $x_1^b > x_1^a$ and $x_2^b \geq x_2^a$, then $b \succ a$

## Intuitive Meaning
"More is better" - consumers always prefer bundles with more goods, assuming all goods provide utility.

## Economic Significance
- Assumes all goods are **desirable** (not bads or neutral goods)
- Eliminates **satiation** points where additional consumption provides no benefit
- Essential for **downward-sloping** [[Indifference Curves]]
- Underlies the assumption that consumers maximize utility subject to budget constraints

## Mathematical Implications
- Ensures [[Indifference Curves]] have **negative slopes** for normal goods
- Prevents indifference curves from being horizontal or vertical
- Guarantees that higher indifference curves represent higher utility levels
- Essential for well-behaved [[Utility Functions]]

## Violations and Special Cases
Monotonicity is violated in cases of:

### [[Bad Goods]]
- Goods that reduce utility (pollution, noise)
- Creates **positively-sloped** indifference curves
- Consumer prefers less of the bad good

### [[Neutral Goods]]
- Goods that don't affect utility
- Creates **horizontal or vertical** indifference curves
- Consumer is indifferent to additional amounts

### Satiation
- Beyond some point, additional consumption reduces utility
- Creates "bliss points" where utility is maximized

## Relationship to Other Axioms
- Part of the "well-behaved preferences" beyond the minimum three axioms
- Works with [[Convexity Axiom]] to create tractable economic models
- Essential for deriving standard results in [[Consumer Theory]]
- Ensures consistency with [[Budget Constraints]] analysis

## Graphical Interpretation
- Higher indifference curves represent preferred bundles
- Movement to the northeast in commodity space represents improvement
- Indifference curves cannot be thick or have positive slopes
