# Ordinary Goods

## Definition
A good is called **ordinary** if the quantity demanded of it always increases as its own price decreases (and vice versa).

## Mathematical Condition
$$\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_1} < 0 \text{ for all } p_1$$

The demand function exhibits a normal (negative) relationship between price and quantity demanded across all price levels.

## Characteristics
- **Downward-sloping** [[Direct Demand Function|demand curve]]
- **Normal price-quantity relationship** throughout entire price range
- **Most common** type of good in economic practice
- Follows standard economic intuition about price and demand

## Price Offer Curve Behavior
For ordinary goods, the [[Price Offer Curve]] slopes downward, connecting optimal bundles that show:
- Decreasing $x_1^*$ as $p_1$ increases
- Smooth, consistent relationship between price changes and consumption

## Graphical Representation
- **Demand curve**: Consistently slopes downward from left to right
- **Price offer curve**: Moves leftward as price increases
- **Standard economic graphs** apply without exceptions

## Economic Intuition
Higher prices for ordinary goods lead to lower quantity demanded because:
1. **Income effect**: Higher prices reduce real purchasing power
2. **Substitution effect**: Consumers switch to relatively cheaper alternatives
3. Both effects work in the same direction, reinforcing the price-quantity relationship

## Market Implications
- **Predictable demand responses** to price changes
- **Standard pricing strategies** are effective
- **Supply and demand analysis** works straightforwardly
- **Price elasticity** calculations are meaningful

## Relationship to Consumer Theory
Ordinary goods satisfy standard assumptions in:
- **Utility maximization** problems
- **Demand function derivation**
- **Comparative statics** analysis
- **Welfare economics** applications

## Contrast with Giffen Goods
Unlike [[Giffen Goods]], ordinary goods:
- Never exhibit upward-sloping demand segments
- Always conform to the "law of demand"
- Don't create theoretical puzzles in consumer choice
- Are the basis for most economic models

## Examples
Most goods in the economy are ordinary:
- Food items, clothing, electronics
- Services like haircuts, transportation
- Entertainment and luxury goods
- Housing and utilities

## Policy Relevance
- **Tax policy**: Predictable responses to price changes through taxation
- **Subsidy programs**: Clear welfare effects
- **Market regulation**: Standard supply-demand analysis applies
