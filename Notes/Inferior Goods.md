# Inferior Goods

## Definition
A good for which quantity demanded **decreases with income** is called **inferior**.

## Mathematical Condition
$$\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} < 0$$

The demand for inferior goods decreases when consumer income increases.

## Engel Curve Characteristics
- **Negatively sloped** [[Engel Curve]]
- Quantity decreases as income increases
- Typically occurs at higher income levels

## Economic Examples
- Generic/store-brand products
- Public transportation (vs. private cars)
- Low-quality substitutes that consumers abandon when income rises
- Basic staple foods in developing countries (at high income levels)

## Income Elasticity
- **Income elasticity**: $\epsilon_m < 0$
- Negative relationship between income and quantity demanded
- Often lower-quality alternatives to [[Normal Goods]]

## Income Offer Curve Implications
When one good is inferior:
- [[Income Offer Curve]] bends backward
- Inferior good consumption falls as income rises
- Normal good consumption rises more than proportionally

## Economic Mechanism
As income rises:
1. Consumers can afford higher-quality substitutes
2. They abandon inferior goods in favor of better alternatives
3. The inferior good becomes a smaller share of total consumption
4. Eventually, consumption of the inferior good may approach zero

## Relationship to Giffen Goods
- All [[Giffen Goods]] are inferior goods
- However, not all inferior goods are Giffen goods
- Giffen behavior requires additional conditions beyond inferiority

## Policy Implications
- Income redistribution affects demand patterns
- Welfare programs may reduce demand for inferior goods
- Economic development may eliminate entire markets
- Understanding poverty consumption patterns

## Real-World Examples
- **Potatoes** during Irish Potato Famine (historically)
- **Ramen noodles** for college students
- **Used goods** vs. new goods
- **Generic medications** vs. brand-name drugs

## Mathematical Example
Consider a consumer with utility function where good 1 becomes inferior at high income levels:

If $x_1^* = f(m)$ where $f'(m) < 0$ for $m > m_0$, then good 1 is inferior for incomes above $m_0$.

## Empirical Considerations
- Income ranges matter - goods can transition from normal to inferior
- Cultural factors influence which goods are considered inferior
- Quality perceptions affect inferiority classification

## Relationship to Other Concepts
- Contrasts with [[Normal Goods]]
- Connected to [[Engel Curve]] analysis
- Important for [[Income Offer Curve]] derivation
- Relevant for [[Giffen Goods]] analysis
