## Budget Set Definition
The **budget set** identifies the set of all bundles that an individual can afford to buy (spending all or part of their income).

$$B(p_1, \ldots, p_n, m) = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid x_1 \geq 0, \ldots, x_n \geq 0 \text{ and } p_1x_1 + \ldots + p_nx_n \leq m\}$$

### Determinants
- Individual's **(disposable) income** $m$
- **Price vector** $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n)$

## Budget Constraint Definition
The **budget constraint** identifies the set of bundles that an individual can **just afford** (spending all income).

$$\{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid x_1 \geq 0, \ldots, x_n \geq 0 \text{ and } p_1x_1 + \ldots + p_nx_n = m\}$$

The budget constraint is the **[[Upper and Lower Bounds|upper boundary]]** of the budget set.

## Two-Commodity Case

### Budget Constraint Equation
$$p_1 \cdot x_1 + p_2 \cdot x_2 = m$$

### Solving for $x_2$
$$x_2 = \frac{m}{p_2} - \frac{p_1}{p_2}x_1$$

### Key Components
- **Vertical intercept**: $\frac{m}{p_2}$
- **Horizontal intercept**: $\frac{m}{p_1}$
- **Slope**: $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$

## Economic Interpretation of Slope

### Opportunity Cost
The slope $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ measures the **[[Opportunity Cost]]** of good $x_1$ with respect to good $x_2$.

- **Opportunity cost of one more unit of good 1**: $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ units foregone of good 2
- **Opportunity cost of one more unit of good 2**: $\frac{p_2}{p_1}$ units foregone of good 1

## Effects of Parameter Changes

### Price Changes
- **Increase in $p_1$**: Budget line rotates inward around vertical intercept (slope becomes steeper)
- **Increase in $p_2$**: Budget line rotates inward around horizontal intercept (slope becomes flatter)

### Income Changes
- **Increase in $m$**: Budget line shifts outward parallel to original line
- **Decrease in $m$**: Budget line shifts inward parallel to original line

## The Numeraire
In economics, the relevant concept for commodity prices is the **relative price** - the price of one commodity in terms of another commodity.

TODO: study p. 26 in the book

## Non-Linear Budget Constraints
When prices are not constant, budget constraints can be curved:
- **[[Quantity Discounts]]**: Convex budget constraint
- **[[Quantity Penalties]]**: Concave budget constraint
- **[[Taxes and Subsidies]]**: Slope changes or parallel shifts
- **[[Quantity Rationing]]**: Kinked budget constraints
