# Real Analysis Fundamentals

## Overview

This note serves as an index for fundamental concepts in real analysis, covering set theory, topology of the real line, and classification of sets and points.

## Set Theory and Bounds

- [[Set Bounds and Extrema]] - Infimum, supremum, maximum, minimum definitions and properties
- [[Absolute Value and Distance]] - Distance function and absolute value in $\mathbb{R}$

## Topological Concepts

### Neighborhoods and Points
- [[Neighborhoods in Real Numbers]] - Definition of neighborhoods, including neighborhoods of infinity
- [[Types of Points in Sets]] - Interior, exterior, boundary, accumulation, and isolated points

### Set Classification  
- [[Set Notation and Classification]] - Standard notation for interior, boundary, and derived sets
- [[Open and Closed Sets]] - Definitions and basic properties of open and closed sets
- [[Open and Closed Set Theorems]] - Fundamental theorems about unions and intersections
- [[Compact Sets]] - Definition and examples of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}$

## Key Relationships

The concepts are interconnected through the following relationships:

1. **Point Classification** leads to **Set Classification**:
   - Interior points → Open sets
   - Boundary points → Closed sets (when contained)
   - Accumulation points → Derived sets

2. **Topological Properties**:
   - Open ↔ Closed (complementary relationship)
   - Closed + Bounded = Compact

3. **Neighborhood Structure** underlies all topological concepts:
   - All definitions of point types use neighborhoods
   - Open sets are characterized by neighborhoods

## Applications

These fundamental concepts form the foundation for:
- Continuity and limits
- Convergence of sequences and series
- Integration and differentiation theory
- Metric space topology
