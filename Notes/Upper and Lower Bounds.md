**Definition**: Consider $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $A \neq \emptyset$.

1) A number $h \in \mathbb{R}$, if it exists, such that $x \leq h$ for all $x \in A$ is called **upper bound** of $A$.

2) A number $k \in \mathbb{R}$, if it exists, such that $x \geq k$ for all $x \in A$ is called **lower bound** of $A$.

_In simple terms_: Could be any number that is greater (or lower) that any other one in the interval

A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $A \neq \emptyset$ is said to be:
- a) **Bounded from above** if it has an upper bound
- b) **Bounded from below** if it has a lower bound  
- c) **Bounded** if it has upper and lower bounds

If there exists an upper/lower bound, then we have infinitely many others.

This concept relies on the [[Order Properties]] of [[Real Numbers]] and is closely related to but distinct from [[Maximum and Minimum]]. The precise characterization of bounds leads to [[Supremum and Infimum]].
