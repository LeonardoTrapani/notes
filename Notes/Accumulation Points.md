For a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$:

$x_0$ is an **accumulation point** of $A$ if for every $N_r(x_0)$ we have:
$$A \cap N_r(x_0) \setminus \{x_0\} \neq \emptyset$$

### Properties
- Every neighborhood contains points of $A$ other than $x_0$ itself
- **Note**: The neighborhood of $x_0$ without $x_0$ is $(x_0 - r, x_0) \cup (x_0, x_0 + r)$
- **Notation**: The set of accumulation points is $A'$ (derived set)

### Key Relationships
- All [[Interior Points]] are accumulation points
- [[Boundary Points]] that are not [[Isolated Points]] are accumulation points

### Example
For $A = (-\infty, 2) \cup [5, 7] \cup (10, 30) \cup \{35\}$:
- $0$ is an accumulation point of $A$  
- $2$ is an accumulation point of $A$
