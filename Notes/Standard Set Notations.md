For a given set $A$:

### Basic Notations
- **Interior of $A$**: $\text{int } A$ (read as "interior of $A$")
- **Exterior of $A$**: $\text{int } A^c$ 
- **Boundary of $A$**: $\partial A$ (read as "boundary of $A$")
- **Accumulation points**: $A'$ (read as "derived set of $A$")

### Related Concepts
- [[Interior Points]] make up $\text{int } A$
- [[Exterior Points]] make up $\text{int } A^c$
- [[Boundary Points]] make up $\partial A$
- [[Accumulation Points]] make up the [[Derived Set Properties|derived set]] $A'$

### Example
For $A = (-\infty, 2) \cup [5, 7] \cup (10, 30) \cup \{35\}$:
- $\text{int } A = (-\infty, 2) \cup (5, 7) \cup (10, 30)$
- $\partial A = \{2, 5, 7, 10, 30, 35\}$
