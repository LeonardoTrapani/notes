A set $A$ is:

### Types of Boundedness
- **Bounded above** if there exists $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \leq M$ for all $x \in A$
- **Bounded below** if there exists $m \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \geq m$ for all $x \in A$  
- **Bounded** if it is both bounded above and below

### Relationship to Other Concepts
- When bounded above, the set may have a [[Infimum and Supremum|supremum]]
- When bounded below, the set may have an [[Infimum and Supremum|infimum]]
- [[Collection of Intervals]] can demonstrate boundedness properties
