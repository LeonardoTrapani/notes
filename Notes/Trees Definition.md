A **tree** is a graph which is:
(a) Connected and 
(b) has no cycles (acyclic).

Trees are fundamental structures in graph theory, representing the simplest connected graphs. They contain exactly enough edges to maintain connectivity without creating any [[Closed Walks and Cycles|cycles]].

Key properties emerge from this definition:
- Every pair of vertices has exactly one path between them
- Removing any edge disconnects the tree  
- Adding any edge creates exactly one cycle

Related concepts:
- [[Connected Graphs]] - Trees are minimal connected graphs
- [[Tree Properties]] - Specific results about vertex count and degrees
- [[Tree Equivalence]] - Alternative characterizations of trees

Trees appear throughout computer science in data structures, spanning trees, and hierarchical representations.
