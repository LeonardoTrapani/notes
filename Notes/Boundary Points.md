For a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$:

$x_0$ is a **boundary point** of $A$ if for every $N_r(x_0)$ we have:
- $N_r(x_0) \cap A \neq \emptyset$ AND  
- $N_r(x_0) \cap A^c \neq \emptyset$

### Properties
- Every neighborhood intersects both the set and its complement
- **Notation**: The set of boundary points is $\partial A$
- Boundary points that are not [[Isolated Points]] are [[Accumulation Points]]

### Example
For $A = (-\infty, 2) \cup [5, 7] \cup (10, 30) \cup \{35\}$:
- $2$ is a boundary point of $A$ and an accumulation point
