Comprehensive notes on fundamental Graph Theory concepts from Computer Science lectures.

## Core Concepts

### Basic Definitions
- [[Simple Graph]] - Basic graph structure with vertices and edges
- [[Vertex Degrees]] - Degree properties of vertices
- [[Subgraphs]] - Graph subsets and relationships
- [[Induced Subgraph]] - Subgraphs induced by vertex or edge sets

### Special Graph Types
- [[Bipartite Graphs]] - Graphs with two disjoint vertex sets
- [[Complete Graphs]] - Fully connected graphs (Kₙ and Kₘ,ₙ)

### Graph Properties
- [[Isomorphism]] - Structural equivalence between graphs
- [[Perfect Matching]] - Complete pairing in bipartite graphs
- [[Chromatic Number]] - Minimum coloring requirements

### Matrix Representations
- [[Adjacency Matrix]] - Vertex-to-vertex relationships
- [[Incidence Matrix]] - Vertex-to-edge relationships

### Fundamental Theorems
- [[Handshaking Lemma]] - Sum of degrees equals twice the number of edges
- [[Corollary - Odd Degree Vertices]] - Even number of odd-degree vertices
