For a walk $W$ we let $\ell(W) =$ no. of edges in $W$.

The length of a walk is simply the count of edges traversed, regardless of whether vertices or edges are repeated.

This concept is fundamental for:
- [[Shortest Path Lemma]] - Finding minimum length paths between vertices
- [[Breadth First Search]] - Systematically exploring vertices by distance
- [[Walks and Matrix Powers]] - Counting walks of specific lengths using adjacency matrices

Related to [[Paths and Walks]] where the length helps distinguish between different types of graph traversal.
