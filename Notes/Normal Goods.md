# Normal Goods

## Definition
A good for which quantity demanded **rises with income** is called **normal**.

## Mathematical Condition
$$\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} > 0$$

The demand for normal goods increases when consumer income increases.

## Engel Curve Characteristics
- **Positively sloped** [[Engel Curve]]
- Quantity increases as income increases
- Represents the typical case for most goods

## Economic Examples
- Most consumer goods: food, clothing, entertainment
- Luxury items: jewelry, premium cars
- Services: healthcare, education

## Classification by Income Elasticity

### Necessities
- **Income elasticity**: $0 < \epsilon_m < 1$
- Demand increases with income but less than proportionally
- Examples: basic food items, utilities

### Luxuries
- **Income elasticity**: $\epsilon_m > 1$ 
- Demand increases more than proportionally with income
- Examples: fine dining, premium brands, vacations

## Income Offer Curve Implications
When both goods are normal:
- [[Income Offer Curve]] slopes upward and outward
- Both consumption quantities increase with income
- Most common scenario in consumer theory

## Cobb-Douglas Example
For utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b$:

Demands: $x_1^* = \frac{am}{(a+b)p_1}$ and $x_2^* = \frac{bm}{(a+b)p_2}$

Both have $\frac{\partial x_i^*}{\partial m} > 0$, so **both goods are normal** for all income levels.

## Policy Implications
- Income growth increases demand
- Relevant for luxury taxes and economic policy
- Economic development increases consumption patterns
- Progressive taxation affects luxury consumption

## Empirical Considerations
- A good can be normal in some income ranges and [[Inferior Goods|inferior]] in others
- Classification depends on the income level being analyzed
- Aggregate data may mask individual variations

## Relationship to Other Concepts
- Contrasts with [[Inferior Goods]]
- Connected to [[Engel Curve]] analysis
- Important for [[Income Offer Curve]] derivation
- Relevant for [[Comparative Statics Analysis]]
