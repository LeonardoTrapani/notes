A walk is **closed** if $v_1 = v_k$. A **cycle** is a closed walk in which the vertices are distinct except for $v_1, v_k$.

Closed walks return to their starting vertex, while cycles are the simplest form of closed walks where no vertex is repeated except the start/end vertex.

Key properties:
- Cycles in [[Bipartite Graphs]] must have even length
- Trees are defined as connected graphs with no cycles
- See [[Bipartite Graph Characterization]] for the relationship between odd cycles and bipartiteness
