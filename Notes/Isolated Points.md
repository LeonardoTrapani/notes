For a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$:

$x_0$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ if there exists $N_r(x_0)$ such that:
$$N_r(x_0) \cap A = \{x_0\}$$

### Properties
- There exists a neighborhood containing only $x_0$ from the set $A$
- Isolated points are a particular case of [[Boundary Points]] that are not [[Accumulation Points]]
- Isolated points are not in the derived set $A'$

### Example
For $A = (-\infty, 2) \cup [5, 7] \cup (10, 30) \cup \{35\}$:
- $35$ is an isolated point
