For a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$:

### Infimum
**Infimum**: $\inf A$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$
- If $A$ has a minimum, then $\inf A = \min A$
- If $A$ has no minimum, $\inf A$ may still exist as the greatest lower bound

### Supremum
**Supremum**: $\sup A$ is the least upper bound of $A$  
- If $A$ has a maximum, then $\sup A = \max A$
- If $A$ has no maximum, $\sup A$ may still exist as the least upper bound

### Relationship to Bounded Sets
- Related to [[Bounded Sets]] - sets that are bounded above or below
- For [[Collection of Intervals]] that are nested: $\inf A = \min A = \sup A = \max A = 0$
