# Bad (Economics)

## Definition
A **bad** is a commodity which **decreases utility** with additional consumption.

## Mathematical Condition
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} < 0$$

The [[Marginal Utility]] is negative - more of the bad always decreases total utility.

## Characteristics
- **Negative marginal utility**: Each additional unit reduces satisfaction
- **Less is preferred to more**: Consumers want to minimize exposure
- **Upward-sloping indifference curves**: When traded against goods
- **Violates [[Monotonicity Axiom]]**: "More is better" does not apply

## Economic Examples
- **Environmental**: Pollution, noise, toxic waste
- **Health-related**: Disease, contamination, harmful substances
- **Social**: Crime, traffic congestion, spam
- **Work-related**: Unpleasant tasks, dangerous conditions

## Utility Function Implications
For a bad $b$ in a utility function $U(x, b)$:
- **Marginal utility is negative**: $MU_b < 0$
- **Utility decreases with consumption**: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial b} < 0$
- **Consumer seeks to minimize**: Optimal consumption is zero if possible

## Indifference Curve Properties
When trading bads against goods:
- **Positive slope**: More bad requires compensation with more good
- **Consumer moves to lower indifference curves**: Higher levels of bad reduce welfare
- **Convexity still possible**: Depending on preferences

## Market Behavior
- **Negative prices**: Consumers must be paid to accept bads
- **Avoidance behavior**: Consumers spend resources to avoid bads
- **Compensating differentials**: Higher wages for jobs involving bads
- **Disposal costs**: Markets for removing or reducing bads

## Economic Analysis Implications

### Consumer Choice
- **Corner solutions** are common (zero consumption if possible)
- **Compensating variation** needed to accept bads
- **Standard optimization** may not apply directly

### Market Outcomes
- **Negative willingness to pay**: Consumers require compensation
- **Externalities**: Bads often imposed without consent
- **Regulation needed**: Markets alone may not handle bads efficiently

## Examples by Category

### Environmental Bads
- **Air pollution**: Reduces health and quality of life
- **Water contamination**: Health risks and aesthetic problems
- **Noise pollution**: Stress and sleep disruption
- **Climate change**: Long-term welfare reduction

### Economic Bads
- **Unemployment**: Loss of income and self-esteem
- **Inflation**: Reduces purchasing power
- **Economic uncertainty**: Planning difficulties

### Social Bads
- **Crime**: Reduces safety and quality of life
- **Traffic congestion**: Time costs and frustration
- **Urban decay**: Aesthetic and property value impacts

## Policy Implications
- **Pigouvian taxes**: Charge producers for creating bads
- **Regulation**: Limit production or exposure to bads
- **Compensation schemes**: Pay those who must accept bads
- **Technology incentives**: Support bad-reducing innovations

## Relationship to Other Classifications

### vs. [[Good (Economics)|Goods]]
- **Bads**: Negative marginal utility, consumers avoid
- **Goods**: Positive marginal utility, consumers seek

### vs. [[Neutral (Economics)|Neutrals]]
- **Bads**: Reduce utility, have negative economic value  
- **Neutrals**: Don't affect utility, no economic value

## Mathematical Example
Consider utility function with good $x$ and bad $b$:
$$U(x,b) = x - b^2$$

Here:
- $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = 1 > 0$ (good)
- $\frac{\partial U}{\partial b} = -2b < 0$ for $b > 0$ (bad)

## Theoretical Importance
Bads help explain:
- **Environmental economics**: Pollution as negative consumption
- **Labor economics**: Compensating differentials for unpleasant work
- **Public policy**: Regulation of harmful activities
- **Welfare analysis**: Full accounting of costs and benefits
