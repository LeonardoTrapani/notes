# Good (Economics)

## Definition
A **good** is a commodity which **increases utility** with additional consumption.

## Mathematical Condition
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} > 0$$

The [[Marginal Utility]] is positive - more of the good always increases total utility.

## Characteristics
- **Positive marginal utility**: Each additional unit increases satisfaction
- **More is preferred to less**: Consumers always want additional quantities
- **Downward-sloping indifference curves**: When traded against other goods
- **Satisfies [[Monotonicity Axiom]]**: "More is better" applies

## Economic Examples
- **Basic necessities**: Food, water, shelter
- **Consumer goods**: Clothing, electronics, books
- **Services**: Entertainment, healthcare, education
- **Luxury items**: Jewelry, premium products

## Utility Function Implications
For a good $x$ in a utility function $U(x, y)$:
- **Marginal utility is positive**: $MU_x > 0$
- **Utility increases with consumption**: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} > 0$
- **No satiation point**: Additional consumption always beneficial

## Indifference Curve Properties
When both commodities are goods:
- **Negative slope**: Trade-offs required between goods
- **Convex shape**: Diminishing marginal rate of substitution
- **Higher curves preferred**: More utility from increased consumption

## Relationship to Consumer Choice
Goods create standard optimization problems:
- **Interior solutions** are typical
- **Budget constraints** limit consumption
- **Standard comparative statics** apply
- **Demand curves slope downward**

## Contrast with Other Classifications

### vs. [[Bad (Economics)|Bads]]
- **Goods**: Positive marginal utility, consumers want more
- **Bads**: Negative marginal utility, consumers want less

### vs. [[Neutral (Economics)|Neutrals]]  
- **Goods**: Affect utility, have economic value
- **Neutrals**: Don't affect utility, no economic value

## Market Implications
- **Positive prices**: Consumers willing to pay for goods
- **Demand curves**: Downward-sloping relationship between price and quantity
- **Supply and demand**: Standard market analysis applies
- **Consumer surplus**: Positive welfare effects from consumption

## Policy Considerations
- **Taxation**: Reduces consumption through price effects
- **Subsidies**: Increase consumption and welfare
- **Public provision**: May be efficient for certain goods
- **Regulation**: Quality and safety standards applicable

## Examples in Different Contexts

### Necessities
- Food, housing, basic clothing
- High utility at low consumption levels
- Relatively inelastic demand

### Luxuries  
- Premium brands, entertainment, travel
- Higher income elasticity
- More elastic demand

### Public Goods
- National defense, street lighting
- Non-rivalrous and non-excludable
- Market failures may occur

## Satiation Considerations
While goods provide positive marginal utility:
- **Practical limits** may exist at very high consumption levels
- **Diminishing marginal utility**: Each additional unit provides less extra satisfaction
- **Budget constraints** typically prevent satiation in practice
