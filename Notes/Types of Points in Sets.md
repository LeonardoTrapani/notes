For a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$, we classify points based on their relationship with neighborhoods.

## Point Classifications

- [[Interior Points]] - Points with neighborhoods contained within the set
- [[Exterior Points]] - Points with neighborhoods contained in the complement
- [[Boundary Points]] - Points where every neighborhood intersects both the set and its complement
- [[Accumulation Points]] - Points where every neighborhood contains other points from the set
- [[Isolated Points]] - Points with neighborhoods containing only themselves from the set

## Key Relationships

- [[Interior Points]] are always [[Accumulation Points]]
- [[Boundary Points]] that are not [[Isolated Points]] are [[Accumulation Points]]

## Example Analysis

For $A = (-\infty, 2) \cup [5, 7] \cup (10, 30) \cup \{35\}$:

- $0$ is an [[Interior Points|interior point]] and [[Accumulation Points|accumulation point]]
- $9$ is an [[Exterior Points|exterior point]]
- $2$ is a [[Boundary Points|boundary point]] and [[Accumulation Points|accumulation point]]
- $35$ is an [[Isolated Points|isolated point]]
