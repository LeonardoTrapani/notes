## Set Notation and Classification

### Standard Set Notations

For a given set $A$:

- **Interior of $A$**: $\text{int } A$ (read as "interior of $A$")
- **Exterior of $A$**: $\text{int } A^c$ 
- **Boundary of $A$**: $\partial A$ (read as "boundary of $A$")
- **Accumulation points**: $A'$ (read as "derived set of $A$")

### Derived Set Properties

The **derived set** $A'$ contains all accumulation points of $A$.

For the example $A = (-\infty, 2) \cup [5, 7] \cup (10, 30) \cup \{35\}$:

$$\text{int } A = (-\infty, 2) \cup (5, 7) \cup (10, 30)$$

$$\partial A = \{2, 5, 7, 10, 30, 35\}$$

$$A' = (-\infty, 2] \cup [5, 7] \cup [10, 30]$$

Notice that:
- The isolated point $35 \notin A'$ (not an accumulation point)
- The boundary points that are also accumulation points are in $A'$
- Interior points are always accumulation points
