**Corollary 1**: In any graph, the number of vertices of odd degree is even.

**Proof**: Let $ODD = \{\text{odd degree vertices}\}$ and $EVEN = V \setminus ODD$.

$$\sum_{v \in ODD} d(v) = 2|E| - \sum_{v \in EVEN} d(v)$$

Since the right side is even, $|ODD|$ must be even. 

_In simple terms_: Right side even because sum of even degrees, and another even number (2* something). So left side must be even too
