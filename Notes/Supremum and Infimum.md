**Definition**: Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $A \neq \emptyset$. We say that:

1) The **supremum** of $A$, if it exists, is the minimum of the upper bounds of $A$ ($\sup A$).

2) The **infimum** of $A$, if it exists, is the maximum of the lower bounds of $A$ ($\inf A$).

This provides a way to characterize the "least upper bound" and "greatest lower bound" when [[Maximum and Minimum]] may not exist within the set itself.

The concepts of supremum and infimum generalize the ideas of [[Upper and Lower Bounds]] and are fundamental in real analysis.
