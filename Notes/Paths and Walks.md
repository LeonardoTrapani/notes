$W = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)$ is a **walk** in $G$ if $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E$ for $1 \leq i < k$. A **path** is a walk in which the vertices are distinct.

A walk represents a sequence of vertices where each consecutive pair is connected by an edge in the [[Simple Graph]]. Unlike cycles, walks can repeat vertices and edges.
