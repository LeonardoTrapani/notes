$K_n = ([n], \{(i,j) : 1 \leq i < j \leq n\})$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices.

The condition $1≤i<j≤n$ ensures we connect every pair of distinct vertices exactly once

_In simple terms_: We have a graph with certain indexes and all indexes are connected to eachother


$K_{m,n} = ([m] \cup [n], \{(i,j) : i \in [m], j \in [n]\})$ is the complete bipartite graph on $m + n$ vertices.

_In simple terms_: a bipartite graph where all vertices are connected to all vertices they can connect to

Every pair of distinct vertices in a complete graph is connected by exactly one edge.
