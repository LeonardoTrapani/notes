For a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$:

$x_0$ is an **exterior point** of $A$ if there exists $N_r(x_0)$ such that $N_r(x_0) \subseteq A^c$.

### Properties
- The point has a full neighborhood contained in the complement of the set
- **Notation**: The set of exterior points is $\text{int } A^c$

### Example
For $A = (-\infty, 2) \cup [5, 7] \cup (10, 30) \cup \{35\}$:
- $9$ is an exterior point of $A$
