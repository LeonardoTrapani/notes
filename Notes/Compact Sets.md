## Compact Sets

### Compact Set Definition

A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is said to be **compact** when $A$ is **closed** and **bounded**.

### Examples of Compact Sets

The following sets are compact:

**Example A**: $A = [-10, 5]$ is compact
- $A$ is closed (contains its boundary points)
- $A$ is bounded

**Example B**: $B = [-10, 0] \cup [3, 5]$ is compact  
- $B$ is closed (contains its boundary points)
- $B$ is bounded

**Example C**: $C = [-20, -10] \cup \{50\}$ is compact
- $C$ is closed (contains its boundary points) 
- $C$ is bounded

**Example D**: $D = \{1\} \cup \{3\} \cup \{50\}$ is compact
- $D$ is closed (discrete set of points)
- $D$ is bounded

### Conditions for Compactness

For a set to be compact, it must satisfy **both conditions**:
1. **Closed**: Contains all its boundary points
2. **Bounded**: There exist real numbers $m$ and $M$ such that $m \leq x \leq M$ for all $x$ in the set

### Non-Compact Sets

Sets that fail either condition are not compact:

- **Open intervals**: $(a, b)$ are bounded but not closed
- **Infinite intervals**: $[a, +\infty)$ are closed but not bounded  
- **Half-open intervals**: $[a, b)$ are bounded but not closed
