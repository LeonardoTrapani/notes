## Open Set Definitions and Properties

Define an open set::A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open when all the points of $A$ are interior points
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

What is the formal definition of an open set?::$A$ is open $\Leftrightarrow \text{int } A = A$
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

Give an example of an open set::$A = (-2, 5) \cup (8, +\infty)$ is open (all points in these intervals are interior points)

## Closed Set Definitions and Properties

Define a closed set::A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed when it contains all its boundary points
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

What is the formal definition of a closed set?::$A$ is closed $\Leftrightarrow \partial A \subseteq A$
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

Give an example of a closed set::$B = [3, +\infty)$ is closed (contains its boundary point $3$: $\partial B = \{3\} \subseteq B$)
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

Why is $\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of integers) closed in $\mathbb{R}$?::$\mathbb{Z}$ is made up of isolated points, so $\partial \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}$, and therefore $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed since it contains all its boundary points

## Sets that are Neither Open nor Closed

Can a set be neither open nor closed?::Yes, a set can be neither open nor closed
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

Give an example of a set that is neither open nor closed::$C = (-\infty, 2) \cup [3, 5]$ is neither open nor closed because point $3$ is not interior (so not open) and point $2$ is boundary but $2 \notin C$ (so not closed)

## Special Cases: Sets that are Both Open and Closed

What is the important remark about open and closed sets?::A set can be neither open nor closed, and some special sets can be both open and closed simultaneously
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

Which sets are both open and closed?::$\mathbb{R}$ (the real numbers) and $\emptyset$ (the empty set) are both open and closed
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

Why is $\mathbb{R}$ both open and closed?::$\mathbb{R}$ is open because every point is an interior point, and $\mathbb{R}$ is closed because it contains all its boundary points (actually, $\mathbb{R}$ has no boundary points)
Source: [[Open and Closed Sets]]

Why is $\emptyset$ both open and closed?::$\emptyset$ is vacuously open (has no points to check for interior property) and vacuously closed (has no boundary points to contain)
