# Microeconomics Chapter 4 - Utility Theory

## Core Definitions

What is a utility function and what does it represent mathematically?
?
A utility function u(x) is a mathematical relationship that assigns numerical values to consumption bundles to represent consumer preferences. It satisfies: a ≿ b ⟺ u(a) ≥ u(b), a ≻ b ⟺ u(a) > u(b), and a ∼ b ⟺ u(a) = u(b).

What is the key difference between ordinal and cardinal utility?
?
**Ordinal utility** only tells us if one alternative is better or worse (ranking only). **Cardinal utility** tells us how much better or worse one alternative is. Utility functions provide ordinal information - only the ordering matters, not the specific numerical values.
Source: [[Ordinal vs Cardinal Utility]]

Define marginal utility mathematically for both discrete and continuous cases.
?
**Discrete case**: MU_xi = ΔU/Δxi
**Continuous case**: MU_xi = ∂U/∂xi (partial derivative)
Marginal utility represents the change in utility from consuming one additional unit of good xi.

## Commodity Classification

How are goods, bads, and neutral commodities classified based on marginal utility?
?
- **Good**: ∂U/∂xi > 0 (consumption increases utility)
- **Bad**: ∂U/∂xi < 0 (consumption decreases utility)  
- **Neutral**: ∂U/∂xi = 0 (consumption doesn't change utility)

## Key Mathematical Relationships

What is the relationship between MRS and marginal utilities?
?
MRS = -MU_x1/MU_x2
This is derived from the condition that utility remains constant along an indifference curve: MU_x1 dx1 = -MU_x2 dx2

## Utility Functions and Indifference Curves

What is the relationship between utility functions and indifference curves?
?
They are equivalent representations of preferences. An indifference map (collection of all indifference curves) is mathematically equivalent to a utility function. Higher indifference curves correspond to higher utility levels, and all bundles on the same indifference curve have the same utility level.

## Monotonic Transformations

If u(x) represents preferences, what other functions can represent the same preferences?
?
Any strictly increasing function f applied to u creates V = f(u) that represents the same preferences. This is called a monotonic transformation. Examples: V = u², V = 2u + 10. The MRS remains unchanged under monotonic transformations.
Source: [[Monotonic Transformation of Utility Functions]]

Why does the MRS remain unchanged under monotonic transformations?
?
Because the MRS captures an invariant property of preferences that depends only on the ordinal ranking of bundles, not the specific numerical utility values. Since monotonic transformations preserve ordinal rankings, they preserve the MRS.

## Specific Utility Function Types

What is the general form of a Cobb-Douglas utility function and give two examples?
?
General form: u(x1, x2) = x1^a x2^b where a > 0 and b > 0
Examples: u(x1, x2) = x1^(1/2) x2^(1/2) and V(x1, x2) = x1 x2³
Source: [[Cobb-Douglas Utility Function]]

For the Cobb-Douglas function u(x1, x2) = x1 x2, what is the MRS?
?
MRS = -x2/x1
This is derived from: ∂u/∂x1 = x2, ∂u/∂x2 = x1, so MRS = -x2/x1
Source: [[Cobb-Douglas Utility Function]]

What are the key properties of Cobb-Douglas indifference curves?
?
- Hyperbolic shape
- Never touch the axes (both goods always needed)
- Show diminishing MRS
- Convex to the origin
- Always well-behaved and satisfy all 5 axioms
Source: [[Cobb-Douglas Utility Function]]

What is the general form of a quasi-linear utility function?
?
u(x1, x2) = f(x1) + x2
The function is non-linear in x1 but linear in x2.
Example: u(x1, x2) = 2x1^(1/2) + x2
Source: [[Quasi-Linear Utility Function]]

What is the distinctive property of quasi-linear indifference curves?
?
Each curve is a vertically shifted copy of the others. All curves have the same shape and differ only by vertical translation.
Source: [[Quasi-Linear Utility Function]]

For quasi-linear utility u(x1, x2) = f(x1) + x2, what are the marginal utilities and MRS?
?
- MU_x1 = f'(x1) (depends on x1 level)
- MU_x2 = 1 (constant)
- MRS = -f'(x1) (depends only on x1, not x2)
Source: [[Quasi-Linear Utility Function]]

What does it mean for goods to be perfect substitutes and what is the utility function form?
?
Perfect substitutes means the consumer is always willing to trade the goods at a constant rate regardless of consumption levels. 
General form: u(x1, x2) = ax1 + bx2
Simple example: V(x1, x2) = x1 + x2
Source: [[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function]]

What are the properties of perfect substitutes indifference curves?
?
- All linear and parallel
- Constant slope (MRS = -a/b)
- No curvature - straight lines throughout
- Consumer typically chooses corner solutions
Source: [[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function]]

For perfect substitutes u(x1, x2) = x1 + x2, what is the MRS?
?
MRS = -1 (constant)
This is because ∂u/∂x1 = 1 and ∂u/∂x2 = 1, so MRS = -1/1 = -1
Source: [[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function]]

What does it mean for goods to be perfect complements and what is the utility function form?
?
Perfect complements means goods must be consumed together in fixed proportions with no benefit from having more of one without more of the other.
General form: u(x1, x2) = min{ax1, bx2}
Simple example: W(x1, x2) = min{x1, x2}
Source: [[Perfect Complements Utility Function]]

What are the properties of perfect complements indifference curves?
?
- L-shaped (right-angled)
- Vertical and horizontal segments only
- Kink points lie on a ray from origin
- For min{x1, x2}: kinks occur where x1 = x2 (45-degree ray)
Source: [[Perfect Complements Utility Function]]

For perfect complements, what is the MRS along different segments?
?
- Along vertical segments: MRS = 0 (no willingness to trade x2 for x1)
- Along horizontal segments: MRS = -∞ (infinite willingness to trade x2 for x1)  
- At the kink: MRS is undefined (discontinuous)

## Comparative Analysis

How do the four main utility function types compare in terms of indifference curve shapes?
?
- **Cobb-Douglas**: Hyperbolic, convex curves
- **Quasi-linear**: Vertically shifted copies of each other
- **Perfect substitutes**: Linear, parallel lines
- **Perfect complements**: L-shaped, right angles
Source: [[Microeconomics Chapter 4 Index]]

What consumption pattern does each utility function type typically lead to?
?
- **Cobb-Douglas**: Interior solutions (consume both goods)
- **Quasi-linear**: Interior for x1, all income effects on x2
- **Perfect substitutes**: Corner solutions (consume only cheaper good)
- **Perfect complements**: Consume at kink points (fixed proportions)
