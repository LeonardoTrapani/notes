## Chapter 2: Budget Constraints

What is the market mechanism and what does it allocate?::The market mechanism allocates goods and services in market economies through the interaction of demand and supply.
Source: [[Market Mechanism and Allocation]]

What do prices measure when markets work?::Prices measure the scarcity of goods and services that are exchanged.
Source: [[Market Mechanism and Allocation]]

What is the behavioral postulate of rational choice theory?::Rational choice theory assumes that individuals choose in a "rational way" - they maximize their well-being subject to scarcity and trade-offs.
Source: [[Rational Choice Theory]]

What are the two steps in the rational choice process?::1) First, identify the set of feasible alternatives, 2) Next, choose "the best" alternative among those feasible.
Source: [[Rational Choice Theory]]

What determines what and how much a consumer demands?::Budget constraints (prices + income) determine what you CAN purchase, while preferences (tastes) determine what you WANT to purchase.
Source: [[Rational Choice Theory]]

What is a consumption bundle mathematically?::A consumption bundle x is a vector where x_i indicates the units of good i: x = (x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ)
Source: [[Consumption Bundles]]

Why do economists often use a two-good model?::To use graphs for analysis, and what we learn using two goods can be extended to n goods.
Source: [[Consumption Bundles]]

What is the budget set?::The budget set identifies the set of ALL bundles that an individual can afford to buy (whether spending all income or not).
Source: [[Budget Set Definition]]

What is the mathematical formulation of the budget set?::B(p₁, ..., pₙ, m) = {(x₁, ..., xₙ) | x₁ ≥ 0, ..., xₙ ≥ 0 and p₁x₁ + ... + pₙxₙ ≤ m}
Source: [[Budget Set Definition]]

What is the budget constraint?::The budget constraint identifies the set of bundles that an individual can JUST afford to buy (spending all income). It is the upper boundary of the budget set.
Source: [[Budget Constraint Definition]]

For two goods, what is the budget constraint equation?::p₁ · x₁ + p₂ · x₂ = m
Source: [[Budget Constraint Definition]]

In the linear form x₂ = (m/p₂) - (p₁/p₂)x₁, what are the three components?::Vertical intercept: m/p₂, Horizontal intercept: m/p₁, Slope: -p₁/p₂
Source: [[Budget Constraint Definition]]

What does the slope of the budget constraint measure economically?::The slope measures the opportunity cost of good x₁ with respect to good x₂.
Source: [[Opportunity Cost and Budget Constraint Slope]]

What is the opportunity cost of an extra unit of good 1?::The opportunity cost is p₁/p₂ units foregone of good 2.
Source: [[Opportunity Cost and Budget Constraint Slope]]

What happens to the budget constraint when p₁ increases?::Horizontal intercept decreases (m/p₁ ↓), vertical intercept stays constant (m/p₂), slope becomes steeper (-p₁/p₂ ↓).
Source: [[Budget Constraint Changes]]

What happens to the budget constraint when income m increases?::Both intercepts increase proportionally, slope remains constant (-p₁/p₂), budget line shifts outward parallel to original line.
Source: [[Budget Constraint Changes]]

What is the key principle for budget constraint changes?::Price changes cause slope changes (rotation), income changes cause parallel shifts.
Source: [[Budget Constraint Changes]]

What is the numeraire concept in economics?::The numeraire relates to relative prices - the price of one commodity in terms of another commodity, rather than absolute prices.
Source: [[Numeraire and Relative Prices]]

When are budget constraints curved instead of straight?::When prices are not constant. If prices are constant, the budget constraint is always a straight line.
Source: [[Non-Linear Budget Constraints]]

Describe quantity ==discounts== and their effect on budget constraints.::Lower price per unit after purchasing a certain quantity, making the budget constraint flatter (less steep) after the discount threshold.
Source: [[Non-Linear Budget Constraints]]

## Chapter 3: Preferences

What are the three types of preference relations?::1) Strict preference (≻), 2) Indifference (~), 3) Weak preference (⪰)
Source: [[Preference Relations]]

What does strict preference (≻) mean?::A consumer strictly prefers bundle a to bundle b.
Source: [[Preference Relations]]

What does indifference (~) mean?::A consumer is indifferent between bundles a and b.
Source: [[Preference Relations]]

What does weak preference (⪰) mean?::A consumer either prefers a to b, or is indifferent between a and b.
Source: [[Preference Relations]]

What are the three basic regularity axioms for preferences?::1) Completeness ("always have an answer"), 2) Reflexivity, 3) Transitivity ("avoid contradictory answers")
Source: [[Regularity Axioms for Preferences]]

What does the completeness axiom state?::For any bundles a and b, either a ⪰ b, or b ⪰ a, or a ~ b. An individual can always compare any two bundles.
Source: [[Regularity Axioms for Preferences]]

What does the transitivity axiom state?::If b ⪰ a and c ⪰ b, then c ⪰ a. Preferences are logically consistent.
Source: [[Regularity Axioms for Preferences]]

What are the five axioms of well-behaved preferences?::1) Completeness, 2) Reflexivity, 3) Transitivity, 4) (Strict) Monotonicity ("more is better"), 5) Convexity ("people prefer variety to extremes")
Source: [[Well-Behaved Preferences]]

What does the monotonicity axiom state?::If x₁ᵇ ≥ x₁ᵃ and x₂ᵇ > x₂ᵃ, then b ≻ a. Having more of at least one good (with no less of the other) is always preferred.
Source: [[Well-Behaved Preferences]]

What does the convexity axiom state?::If a ~ b, then for any 0 ≤ t ≤ 1: t·a + (1-t)·b ⪰ a and t·a + (1-t)·b ⪰ b. Any mixture of equally preferred bundles is at least as good as either alone.
Source: [[Well-Behaved Preferences]]

What is an indifference curve?::Given bundle a, the indifference curve I is the set of bundles (x₁, x₂) which the individual considers as good as bundle a: I = {(x₁, x₂) | (x₁, x₂) ~ a}
Source: [[Indifference Curves]]

What are the two ways of representing individual preferences?::1) Indifference curves (approach due to Vilfredo Pareto), 2) Utility functions (U)
Source: [[Indifference Curves]]

How does an indifference curve divide all bundles?::1) Bundles above the curve: strictly preferred, 2) Bundles on the curve: indifferent, 3) Bundles below the curve: less preferred
Source: [[Indifference Curves]]

List the six properties of well-behaved indifference curves.::1) Preference ordering by distance from origin, 2) Complete coverage, 3) Non-crossing property, 4) Downward slope for "goods", 5) Thin curves, 6) Convex shape
Source: [[Properties of Well-Behaved Indifference Curves]]

Why can't indifference curves cross?::If curves crossed, the transitivity axiom would be violated, creating logical inconsistencies in preferences.
Source: [[Properties of Well-Behaved Indifference Curves]]

Why do indifference curves slope downward for "goods"?::Due to the monotonicity axiom - when both commodities are goods, curves must have negative slope.
Source: [[Properties of Well-Behaved Indifference Curves]]

What does the convex shape of indifference curves imply?::1) Individuals prefer to diversify consumption, 2) Linear combinations of bundles on an IC are preferred to either bundle, 3) MRS is diminishing
Source: [[Properties of Well-Behaved Indifference Curves]]

What is the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)?::The ratio at which the individual is willing to trade/exchange one good with the other and remain equally "happy." It is the slope of the indifference curve.
Source: [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]]

What is the mathematical expression for MRS?::MRS_{x₁,x₂} = dx₂/dx₁ (the slope of the indifference curve)
Source: [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]]

What does diminishing MRS mean?::For convex indifference curves, the absolute value of the MRS decreases as we move along the curve.
Source: [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]]

What are perfect ==substitutes== and what axiom do they violate?::Units of commodities are always regarded as equivalent, only total amount matters. They violate strict convexity. IC are straight lines with constant MRS.
Source: [[Violations of Well-Behaved Preferences]]

What are perfect ==complements== and what axiom do they violate?::Commodities consumed in fixed proportions, only number of pairs matters. They violate monotonicity. IC are L-shaped with MRS of zero, infinite, or undefined.
Source: [[Violations of Well-Behaved Preferences]]

Who is associated with perfect complements?::Economist Wassily Leontief (Nobel Prize 1973)
Source: [[Violations of Well-Behaved Preferences]]

What characterizes concave indifference curves?::They violate convexity. Individuals prefer NOT to diversify consumption, linear combinations are less preferred than extreme bundles, MRS is increasing.
Source: [[Violations of Well-Behaved Preferences]]

What are "bads" and how do they affect indifference curves?::Examples: pollution, garbage, noise. They violate monotonicity. More "bads" is less preferred. IC are positively sloped with positive MRS.
