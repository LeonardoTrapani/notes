## Behavioral Postulate

What does the behavioral postulate in economics state?::A decision maker always chooses his or her **most preferred** alternative from his or her set of **available** alternatives.
Source: [[Behavioral Postulate and Rational Choice]]

What are the two steps of rational choice according to the behavioral postulate?::1) Identify feasible options (budget set) 2) Select optimal choice given preferences 
Source: [[Behavioral Postulate and Rational Choice]]

The mathematical formulation of rational choice is: $$\max_{x_1,x_2} U(x_1, x_2)$$ subject to ==$$p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$$==

## Interior Solution Conditions

Define an interior solution in consumer choice theory.::An optimal bundle $x^* = (x_1^*, x_2^*)$ where both $x_1^* > 0$ and $x_2^* > 0$ (individual chooses both commodities)
Source: [[Optimality Conditions for Interior Solutions]]

What are the two required conditions for interior solutions?::1) **Feasibility**: $p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$ 2) **Optimality (Tangency)**: $MRS(x^*) = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$
Source: [[Optimality Conditions for Interior Solutions]]

Express the tangency condition using marginal utilities.::$$\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$$
Source: [[Optimality Conditions for Interior Solutions]]

The "marginal utility per euro" formulation of optimality is: $$\frac{MU_{x_1}}{p_1} = ==\frac{MU_{x_2}}{p_2}==$$
Source: [[Optimality Conditions for Interior Solutions]]

What is the economic intuition behind the tangency condition?::At the optimal bundle: "how much I MUST trade off" (budget constraint slope) = "how much I WANT to trade off" (MRS)

## Corner Solution Conditions

Define a corner solution in consumer choice theory.::An optimal bundle where the individual chooses only one good: either $x_1^* > 0, x_2^* = 0$ OR $x_1^* = 0, x_2^* > 0$
Source: [[Optimality Conditions for Corner Solutions]]

For corner solutions where $x_1^* > 0, x_2^* = 0$, the optimality condition is: $$MRS(x^*) \geq ==\frac{p_1}{p_2}==$$
Source: [[Optimality Conditions for Corner Solutions]]

For corner solutions where $x_1^* = 0, x_2^* > 0$, the optimality condition is: $$MRS(x^*) \leq ==\frac{p_1}{p_2}==$$
Source: [[Optimality Conditions for Corner Solutions]]

How do corner solutions differ from interior solutions regarding the tangency condition?::Corner solutions do **not** require the tangency condition $MRS = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$ to hold exactly - only inequality conditions

## Mathematical Approach

State the constrained optimization problem for utility maximization.::$$\max_{x_1,x_2} U(x_1, x_2)$$ subject to $$p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$$
Source: [[Mathematical Approach to Utility Maximization]]

For well-behaved preferences, what system of equations must be solved?::1) **Optimality**: $\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$ 2) **Feasibility**: $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$
Source: [[Mathematical Approach to Utility Maximization]]

The solution to the utility maximization problem yields: $x_1^* = x_1(p_1, p_2, m)$ and $x_2^* = x_2(p_1, p_2, m)$. These are called ==**Marshallian demand functions**==
Source: [[Mathematical Approach to Utility Maximization]]

For perfect complements with kinked indifference curves, what replaces the tangency condition?::$$x_1^* = x_2^*$$ (the optimality condition at the kink)

## Monotonic Transformations

Consider the Cobb-Douglas utility functions: $U_1 = x_1^{1/2}x_2^{1/2}$, $U_2 = x_1x_2$, and $U_3 = \ln x_1 + \ln x_2$. What do their demand functions have in common?::They yield **identical demand functions**: $x_1 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{p_1}$ and $x_2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{p_2}$
Source: [[Monotonic Transformations and Demand Equivalence]]

Why do monotonic transformations of utility functions yield identical demand functions?::Because utility is **ordinal** - monotonic transformations preserve the preference ordering and the MRS, leading to identical optimal choices
Source: [[Monotonic Transformations and Demand Equivalence]]

For general Cobb-Douglas $U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b$, what are the demand functions?::$$x_1 = \frac{a}{a+b}\frac{m}{p_1}, \quad x_2 = \frac{b}{a+b}\frac{m}{p_2}$$

## Solution Types by Preference

Which preference types **always** yield interior solutions?::1) **Cobb-Douglas preferences** 2) **Perfect complements**
Source: [[Summary of Preference Types and Optimal Solutions]]

Which preference types **always** yield corner solutions?::1) **Neutral goods** 2) **Concave preferences** ("addiction")
Source: [[Summary of Preference Types and Optimal Solutions]]

Which preference types can yield **both** interior and corner solutions?::1) **Perfect substitutes** 2) **Quasi-linear preferences**
Source: [[Summary of Preference Types and Optimal Solutions]]

For Cobb-Douglas preferences, demand functions depend on ==**own price and income only**== (not other good's price)
Source: [[Summary of Preference Types and Optimal Solutions]]

For perfect complements, demand functions depend on the ==**sum of both prices**== $(p_1 + p_2)$
Source: [[Summary of Preference Types and Optimal Solutions]]

For perfect substitutes, the solution type depends on: comparing $MRS$ with ==**$\frac{p_1}{p_2}$**== (relative prices vs. preference trade-off)

## Demand Curve Characteristics

Describe the demand curve shape for Cobb-Douglas preferences.::**Smooth, downward-sloping hyperbolic curve** that is continuous at all price levels
Source: [[Demand Curve Characteristics by Preference Type]]

Describe the demand curve shape for perfect substitutes.::**Horizontal line** at the critical price, then **vertical drop** - extremely discontinuous
Source: [[Demand Curve Characteristics by Preference Type]]

Describe the demand curve shape for perfect complements.::**Smooth, downward-sloping curve** similar to Cobb-Douglas but with quantity $x_1 = \frac{m}{p_1 + p_2}$
Source: [[Demand Curve Characteristics by Preference Type]]

For neutral goods with vertical indifference curves, the demand curve is: ==**perfectly vertical**== at $x_1 = m/p_1$
Source: [[Demand Curve Characteristics by Preference Type]]

For neutral goods with horizontal indifference curves, the demand curve is: ==**perfectly horizontal**== at $x_1 = 0$

## Key Economic Insights

What determines whether a solution is interior or corner?::Whether individuals want to consume **some of both goods** (interior) or prefer to **specialize completely** in one good (corner)
Source: [[Summary of Preference Types and Optimal Solutions]]

Corner solutions occur due to three main factors: ==**extreme preferences**== (neutral/concave), **unfavorable relative prices** (perfect substitutes), or **budget constraints** (quasi-linear with low income)
Source: [[Summary of Preference Types and Optimal Solutions]]

The universal feasibility condition that applies to all solution types is: $$p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = ==m==$$
