## Compact Set Definition and Conditions

Define a compact set::A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is compact when $A$ is **closed** and **bounded**

What are the two conditions required for a set to be compact?::1) Closed: Contains all its boundary points, 2) Bounded: There exist real numbers $m$ and $M$ such that $m \leq x \leq M$ for all $x$ in the set

Must both conditions be satisfied for compactness?::Yes, for a set to be compact, it must satisfy **both conditions**: closed AND bounded

## Examples of Compact Sets

Is $A = [-10, 5]$ compact? Explain::Yes, $A$ is compact because it is closed (contains its boundary points) and bounded

Is $B = [-10, 0] \cup [3, 5]$ compact? Explain::Yes, $B$ is compact because it is closed (contains its boundary points) and bounded

Is $C = [-20, -10] \cup \{50\}$ compact? Explain::Yes, $C$ is compact because it is closed (contains its boundary points) and bounded

Is $D = \{1\} \cup \{3\} \cup \{50\}$ compact? Explain::Yes, $D$ is compact because it is closed (discrete set of points) and bounded

## Non-Compact Sets

What types of sets fail to be compact?::Sets that fail either the closed condition or the bounded condition (or both) are not compact
<!--SR:!2025-09-15,4,270-->
Source: [[Compact Sets]]

Give examples of sets that are bounded but not closed::Open intervals like $(a, b)$ are bounded but not closed, so they are not compact
<!--SR:!2025-09-15,4,270-->
Source: [[Compact Sets]]

Give examples of sets that are closed but not bounded::Infinite intervals like $[a, +\infty)$ are closed but not bounded, so they are not compact
<!--SR:!2025-09-15,4,275-->
Source: [[Compact Sets]]

Give examples of sets that are bounded but not closed::Half-open intervals like $[a, b)$ are bounded but not closed, so they are not compact
<!--SR:!2025-09-15,4,270-->
Source: [[Compact Sets]]

Why is $(a, b)$ not compact?::$(a, b)$ is bounded but not closed (doesn't contain its boundary points $a$ and $b$), so it fails the closed condition for compactness
Source: [[Compact Sets]]

Why is $[a, +\infty)$ not compact?::$[a, +\infty)$ is closed but not bounded (extends infinitely), so it fails the bounded condition for compactness
Source: [[Compact Sets]]

Why is $[a, b)$ not compact?::$[a, b)$ is bounded but not closed (doesn't contain its boundary point $b$), so it fails the closed condition for compactness
