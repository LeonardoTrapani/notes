# Real Number Theory

This index organizes the fundamental concepts of real number theory and their relationships.

## Number Systems
- [[Number Sets Hierarchy]] - The nested structure of $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$
- [[Irrational Numbers]] - Numbers that cannot be expressed as rationals
- [[Real Numbers]] - The complete number system containing rationals and irrationals

## Operations and Properties
- [[Operations in ‚Ñù]] - Sum and product operations in the reals
- [[Order Properties]] - Total ordering in the real numbers

## Intervals and Bounds
- [[Infinity Symbols]] - The meaning of $+\infty$ and $-\infty$
- [[Intervals]] - Subsets of reals defined by ordering
- [[Upper and Lower Bounds]] - Bounds for subsets of reals
- [[Maximum and Minimum]] - Extreme values within sets
- [[Supremum and Infimum]] - Least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds
