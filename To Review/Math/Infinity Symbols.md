The symbols "$+\infty$" and "$-\infty$" are used in a simple way:
- "$+\infty$ means: so far on the right"
- "$-\infty$ means: so far on the left"

**Important**: $+\infty$ and $-\infty$ are **not** real numbers!

Graphically, there's a way to "touch" $\pm \infty$ by considering a semi-circle and a line (the real line), where we have a one-to-one relation between points of the semi-circle and the line. The left and right extremes of the semi-circle correspond to $-\infty$ and $+\infty$ respectively.

These symbols are commonly used in defining [[Intervals]] and discussing [[Upper and Lower Bounds]].
