$\mathbb{R}$ is the set that contains all rational and [[Irrational Numbers]].

The complete hierarchy is: $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$

$\mathbb{R}$ is large enough geometrically - we can use the "real line" to represent the set $\mathbb{R}$.

Any point on the real line corresponds to a real number, providing a geometric representation of the complete number system.

The real numbers support fundamental [[Operations in ‚Ñù]] and have important [[Order Properties]] that allow us to work with concepts like [[Intervals]] and [[Upper and Lower Bounds]].
