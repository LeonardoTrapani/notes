Numbers that cannot be expressed as rational numbers $\frac{m}{n}$ are called **irrational numbers**.

Key example: $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational - it's impossible to write $\sqrt{2}$ as a rational number $\frac{m}{n}$.

Other irrational numbers include: $\sqrt{3}$, $\sqrt[3]{7}$, $\pi$, etc.

These numbers exist beyond the rationals defined in [[Number Sets Hierarchy]] and necessitate the construction of a larger number system - the [[Real Numbers]].
