## Definition

The plot of the $x_1$-coordinate of the $p_1$-[[Price Offer Curve|price offer curve]] against $p_1$ is the **direct demand curve** for commodity 1.

## Mathematical Form

The direct demand function expresses quantity as a function of price:
$$x_1^* = f(p_1 | p_2, m)$$

Where:
- $x_1^*$ = quantity demanded of good 1
- $p_1$ = price of good 1  
- $p_2, m$ = held constant (other price and income)

## Key Question Answered

"Given the price for commodity 1, what is the quantity demanded of commodity 1?"

This is the **standard** way of expressing demand relationships.

## Relationship to Price Offer Curve

The direct demand function is derived from the [[Price Offer Curve]]:
1. Take each point on the price offer curve: $(x_1^*(p_1'), x_2^*(p_1'))$
2. Extract the $x_1$-coordinate: $x_1^*(p_1')$
3. Plot this against the corresponding price $p_1'$
4. The resulting curve is the direct demand function

## Types by Good Classification

### Ordinary Goods
- **Downward-sloping** demand curve
- Higher price → Lower quantity demanded
- Most common type in practice

### Giffen Goods
- **Upward-sloping** segments possible
- Higher price → Higher quantity demanded (for some price ranges)
- Theoretical curiosity, rare in practice

## Contrast with Inverse Demand Function

- **Direct**: $x$ is function of $p$ → $x_1^* = f(p_1)$
- **[[Inverse Demand Function]]**: $p$ is function of $x$ → $p_1 = g(x_1^*)$

## Applications

- Foundation for market demand curves
- Price elasticity analysis  
- Consumer surplus calculations
- Market equilibrium analysis
