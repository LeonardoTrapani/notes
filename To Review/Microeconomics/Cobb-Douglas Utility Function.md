## Definition

Any utility function of the form:
$$u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b$$
with $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ is called a **Cobb-Douglas utility function**.

## Examples

### Standard Form
$$u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2} \quad (a = b = 1/2)$$

### Alternative Form
$$V(x_1, x_2) = x_1 x_2^3 \quad (a = 1, b = 3)$$

## Properties

### Well-Behaved Preferences
Cobb-Douglas [[Indifference Curves|indifference curves]] are:
- **Always well behaved** (convex, monotonic)
- **Satisfy all 5 [[Preference Axioms|preference axioms]]**
- Smooth and continuously differentiable

### Shape Characteristics
- Indifference curves are **hyperbolic**
- Never touch the axes (both goods always consumed in positive amounts)
- Exhibit **diminishing marginal rate of substitution**

## Marginal Utilities

For the general form $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b$:

$$MU_{x_1} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} = a x_1^{a-1} x_2^b$$

$$MU_{x_2} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = b x_1^a x_2^{b-1}$$

## Marginal Rate of Substitution

$$MRS = -\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = -\frac{a x_1^{a-1} x_2^b}{b x_1^a x_2^{b-1}} = -\frac{a x_2}{b x_1}$$

### Special Case: $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 x_2$
When $a = b = 1$:
$$MRS = -\frac{x_2}{x_1}$$

## Economic Applications

Cobb-Douglas utility functions are widely used because they:
- Represent realistic consumer behavior
- Are mathematically tractable
- Generate interior solutions in optimization problems
- Allow for flexible substitution patterns between goods
