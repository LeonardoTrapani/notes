# Indifference Curves

## Definition
Given bundle $a = (x_1^a, x_2^a)$, the **indifference curve** $I$ is the set of bundles $(x_1, x_2)$ which the individual considers as good as bundle $a$:

$$I = \{(x_1, x_2) \mid (x_1, x_2) \sim a\}$$

The individual is "indifferent" in the sense that they are willing to exchange these bundles and remain equally satisfied.

## Properties of Well-Behaved Indifference Curves

### 1. Higher Preference for Distant Curves
Bundles on indifference curves **farther from the origin** are preferred to bundles on curves **closer to the origin**.
- **Reason**: [[Monotonicity Axiom]]

### 2. Universal Coverage  
**Every bundle lies on an indifference curve**.
- **Reason**: [[Completeness Axiom]]

### 3. Non-Crossing Property
**Indifference curves for the same individual cannot cross**.
- **Proof by contradiction**: Crossing would violate [[Transitivity Axiom]] and [[Monotonicity Axiom]]

### 4. Negative Slope for Goods
When both commodities are "goods," **indifference curves slope downward** (negative slope).
- **Reason**: [[Monotonicity Axiom]] requires trade-offs between goods

### 5. Thin Curves
**Indifference curves cannot be thick**.
- **Reason**: Thickness would violate [[Monotonicity Axiom]]

### 6. Convexity
**Indifference curves are convex** (bow toward the origin).
- **Reason**: [[Convexity Axiom]] - people prefer variety
- **Implication**: Any linear combination of bundles on an indifference curve is preferred to the extreme bundles

## Slope of Indifference Curves
The slope of an indifference curve is given by:

$$\text{slope} = \frac{dx_2}{dx_1}$$

Under the [[Monotonicity Axiom]], this slope is always **negative** for goods.

## Indifference Map
An **indifference map** is a collection of indifference curves representing a consumer's complete preference ordering over all possible bundles.

## Economic Interpretation
Indifference curves divide the consumption space into three regions:
- **Above the curve**: Strictly preferred bundles
- **On the curve**: Equally preferred bundles  
- **Below the curve**: Less preferred bundles

## Connection to Marginal Rate of Substitution
The slope of an indifference curve equals the [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] between the two goods.
