## Constrained Optimal Choice

**Definition**: A bundle of commodities $x^* = (x_1^*, x_2^*)$ is an optimal bundle if, given the individual's income and the prices of the commodities:

1. The individual can afford to purchase this bundle (**constrained choice**)
2. The individual will not exchange this bundle with any other bundles because this bundle maximizes their utility (**optimal choice**)

### Mathematical Formulation

The constrained optimization problem:
$$\max_{x_1, x_2} U(x_1, x_2)$$
$$\text{subject to } p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$$

### Solution Conditions

For an optimal bundle $x^*$, two conditions must be satisfied:

#### Feasibility Condition
The bundle must lie on the [[Budget Constraints|budget constraint]]:
$$p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$$

#### Optimality Condition
At the optimal bundle, "how much I MUST trade off" coincides with "how much I WANT to trade off":

**Budget constraint** tells the individual how many units of commodity 2 they must give up to consume one more unit of commodity 1: $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$

**[[Indifference Curves]]** tell the individual how many units of commodity 2 they are willing to give up to obtain one more unit of commodity 1 and be equally happy: $MRS(x^*)$

### Economic Intuition

The optimal choice represents the point where the individual's preferences (captured by [[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]]) align with market constraints (relative prices). This is the foundation for deriving [[Demand Function Derivation|demand functions]].
