## Definition

A utility function of the form:
$$u(x_1, x_2) = f(x_1) + x_2$$
is **linear in just $x_2$** and is called **quasi-linear**.

## Example

$$u(x_1, x_2) = 2x_1^{1/2} + x_2$$

## Key Properties

### Linearity in One Good
- The function is **linear** in good $x_2$ (the coefficient is constant)
- The function can be **non-linear** in good $x_1$ (through function $f(x_1)$)

### Indifference Curve Characteristics
- Each indifference curve is a **vertically shifted copy** of the others
- All curves have the **same shape** but different vertical positions
- The [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] depends only on $x_1$, not on $x_2$

## Marginal Utilities

For the general form $u(x_1, x_2) = f(x_1) + x_2$:

$$MU_{x_1} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} = f'(x_1)$$

$$MU_{x_2} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = 1$$

## Marginal Rate of Substitution

$$MRS = -\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = -\frac{f'(x_1)}{1} = -f'(x_1)$$

### Key Insight
The MRS depends **only on $x_1$**, not on $x_2$. This means:
- Moving vertically along any indifference curve (changing $x_2$ while holding $x_1$ constant) does not change the MRS
- The slope is the same at all points with the same $x_1$ coordinate

## Economic Interpretation

Quasi-linear utility functions are useful when:
- One good (typically $x_2$) represents "money" or a numeraire
- [[Marginal Utility]] of money is constant
- Income effects are absent for the non-linear good
- Analyzing partial equilibrium models where one market is isolated
