## Definitions

### Good
A **good** is a commodity which **increases utility** with additional consumption.
- [[Marginal Utility]] is positive: $MU > 0$
- More of the good is always preferred to less
- Examples: food, entertainment, housing

### Bad  
A **bad** is a commodity which **decreases utility** with additional consumption.
- Marginal utility is negative: $MU < 0$  
- Less of the bad is preferred to more
- Examples: pollution, noise, disease

### Neutral
A **neutral** is a commodity which **does not change utility** with additional consumption.
- Marginal utility is zero: $MU = 0$
- Consumer is indifferent to having more or less
- Examples: worthless objects, items beyond satiation point

## Graphical Representation

Consider water consumption as an example:
- **Left region**: Water units are **goods** (increasing utility)
- **Peak**: Optimal consumption level  
- **Right region**: Water units are **bads** (decreasing utility)
- **Around $x'$ units**: A little extra water is a **neutral** (flat utility curve)

## Mathematical Implications

### Utility Function Shape
For a good that transitions from good to bad:
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} \begin{cases}
> 0 & \text{when } x \text{ is a good} \\
= 0 & \text{when } x \text{ is neutral} \\
< 0 & \text{when } x \text{ is a bad}
\end{cases}$$

### Indifference Curve Implications
- **Goods**: Indifference curves slope downward (negative MRS)
- **Bads**: Indifference curves slope upward (positive MRS)  
- **Neutrals**: Indifference curves are vertical (infinite MRS) or horizontal (zero MRS)

## Economic Applications

Understanding goods, bads, and neutrals helps explain:
- Why some markets don't exist (for neutrals)
- Why people pay to avoid bads (pollution taxes)
- Satiation points in consumption
- Corner solutions in consumer optimization

## Relationship to Preferences

This classification connects to the [[Preference Axioms|monotonicity axiom]]:
- When all commodities are goods, "more is better"
- When some commodities are bads, preferences become more complex
- Consumer choice involves trading off goods against bads
