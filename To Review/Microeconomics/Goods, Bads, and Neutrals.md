# Goods, Bads, and Neutrals

## Overview
Commodities can be classified based on how they affect consumer utility. This classification helps explain consumer behavior, market outcomes, and policy implications.

## Types of Commodities by Utility Impact

### [[Good (Economics)|Good]]
A commodity which **increases utility** with additional consumption.
- Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} > 0$
- Examples: food, entertainment, housing

### [[Bad (Economics)|Bad]]  
A commodity which **decreases utility** with additional consumption.
- Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} < 0$
- Examples: pollution, noise, disease

### [[Neutral (Economics)|Neutral]]
A commodity which **does not change utility** with additional consumption.
- Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = 0$
- Examples: worthless objects, items beyond satiation point

## Utility Function Relationship
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} \begin{cases}
> 0 & \text{when } x \text{ is a good} \\
= 0 & \text{when } x \text{ is neutral} \\
< 0 & \text{when } x \text{ is a bad}
\end{cases}$$

## Indifference Curve Implications
- **[[Good (Economics)|Goods]]**: Downward-sloping indifference curves
- **[[Bad (Economics)|Bads]]**: Upward-sloping indifference curves  
- **[[Neutral (Economics)|Neutrals]]**: Horizontal or vertical indifference curves

## Economic Applications
This classification explains:
- **Market existence**: Why markets for neutrals don't develop
- **Pricing patterns**: Negative prices for bads, zero prices for neutrals
- **Consumer behavior**: Avoidance of bads, indifference to neutrals
- **Policy design**: Regulation of bads, taxes and subsidies

## Relationship to Consumer Theory
Connects to fundamental economic concepts:
- **[[Monotonicity Axiom]]**: Applies only when all commodities are goods
- **[[Marginal Utility]]**: Sign determines classification
- **Consumer optimization**: Corner vs. interior solutions
- **Welfare analysis**: Complete utility characterization
