## Definition

The curve containing all the utility-maximizing bundles traced out as $p_1$ changes, with $p_2$ and $m$ constant, is the **$p_1$-price offer curve**.

## Construction

1. Fix $p_2$ and $m$ constant
2. Vary the price of good 1: $p_1' < p_1'' < p_1'''$
3. Find the optimal bundle at each price level
4. Connect these optimal points to form the price offer curve

## Mathematical Representation

The price offer curve shows the relationship between optimal consumption bundles $(x_1^*, x_2^*)$ as $p_1$ varies, subject to:
- Budget constraint: $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$
- Utility maximization conditions

## Relationship to Demand Curve

The price offer curve is directly related to the [[Direct Demand Function]]:
- The $x_1$-coordinates of points on the price offer curve, when plotted against their corresponding $p_1$ values, form the direct demand curve
- This transformation converts the price offer curve from $(x_1, x_2)$ space to $(x_1, p_1)$ space

## Types Based on Good Classification

### Ordinary Goods
- Price offer curve slopes downward from left to right
- As price increases, quantity demanded decreases

### Giffen Goods  
- Price offer curve can bend backward
- Creates upward-sloping segments in the [[Direct Demand Function|demand curve]]
