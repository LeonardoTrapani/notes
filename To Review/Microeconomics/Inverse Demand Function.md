## Definition

The inverse demand function expresses price as a function of quantity demanded.

## Mathematical Form

$$p_1 = g(x_1^* | p_2, m)$$

Where:
- $p_1$ = price of good 1
- $x_1^*$ = quantity demanded of good 1
- $p_2, m$ = held constant (other price and income)

## Key Question Answered

"At what price for commodity 1 would a given quantity of commodity 1 be demanded?"

This **inverts** the typical demand question asked by the [[Direct Demand Function]].

## Relationship to Direct Demand Function

The inverse demand function is the mathematical inverse of the [[Direct Demand Function]]:

- **Direct**: $x_1^* = f(p_1)$ → "Given price, find quantity"
- **Inverse**: $p_1 = f^{-1}(x_1^*)$ → "Given quantity, find price"

## Graphical Interpretation  

When we plot a demand curve with:
- **Price on vertical axis**
- **Quantity on horizontal axis**

We are actually plotting the **inverse demand function**, even though we often call it the "demand curve."

## Applications

### Economic Analysis
- **Consumer surplus** calculations
- **Producer surplus** analysis  
- **Marginal revenue** derivation (for monopolists)
- **Welfare analysis**

### Market Mechanisms
- **Auction theory** - finding market-clearing prices
- **Price discovery** mechanisms
- **Supply and demand** equilibrium analysis

## Relationship to Utility Theory

The inverse demand function represents the **marginal willingness to pay** for each unit of the good, derived from the consumer's [[Utility Functions|utility maximization]].
