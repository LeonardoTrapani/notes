# Quantity Discounts and Budget Constraints

## Non-Linear Budget Constraints
When prices are **not constant**, budget constraints deviate from straight lines and become **curved**.

## Quantity Discount Structure

### Definition  
A **quantity discount** occurs when the price per unit **decreases** after purchasing a certain threshold quantity.

### Mathematical Example
Suppose:
- **Income**: $m = 100$ euros
- **Price of $x_2$**: constant at $p_2 = 1$ euro
- **Price of $x_1$**: 
  - $p_1 = 2$ euros for $0 \leq x_1 \leq 20$
  - $p_1 = 1$ euro for $x_1 > 20$

### Budget Constraint Equations
$$2 \cdot x_1 + 1 \cdot x_2 = 100 \quad \text{for } 0 \leq x_1 \leq 20$$
$$1 \cdot x_1 + 1 \cdot x_2 = 100 \quad \text{for } x_1 > 20$$

### Slope Analysis
The budget constraint slope ($-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$):
- **Slope = -2** for $0 \leq x_1 \leq 20$ (steeper segment)
- **Slope = -1** for $x_1 > 20$ (flatter segment)

## Graphical Representation

### Shape Characteristics
- **Kinked line**: Changes slope at the discount threshold
- **Convex to origin**: Expands budget set compared to linear constraint
- **Two segments**: Different slopes reflecting different price regimes

### Key Points
- **Vertical intercept**: 100 (when $x_1 = 0$)
- **Kink point**: At $x_1 = 20$, where price changes
- **Horizontal intercept**: 100 (when $x_2 = 0$ and using discounted price)

## Budget Set Implications

### Expanded Opportunities
The quantity discount **expands the budget set** compared to constant pricing:
- More consumption bundles become feasible
- Consumer welfare potentially increases
- **Non-convex** feasible region at the kink

### Strategic Implications
- May incentivize **bulk purchasing**
- Can lead to **corner solutions** at the kink point
- Creates **threshold effects** in consumer behavior

## Other Non-Linear Budget Constraints

### Related Concepts
- **[[Quantity Penalties]]**: Price increases with quantity
- **[[Progressive Taxation]]**: Tax rates increase with income
- **[[Quantity Rationing]]**: Limits on maximum purchase quantities
- **[[Subsidies and Taxes]]**: Government interventions affecting prices

### Economic Applications
- **Utility companies**: Tiered pricing structures
- **Retail stores**: Volume discounts for bulk purchases  
- **Subscription services**: Decreasing per-unit costs with higher tiers
- **Insurance premiums**: Deductibles creating kinked budget constraints

## Consumer Behavior Analysis
With quantity discounts:
- **Substitution effects** vary across price ranges
- **Income effects** may create discontinuous demand
- **Optimal choices** may occur at kink points
- **Comparative statics** become more complex
