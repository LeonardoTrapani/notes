## Ordinary Goods

### Definition
A good is called **ordinary** if the quantity demanded of it always increases as its own price decreases (and vice versa).

### Characteristics
- **Downward-sloping** [[Direct Demand Function|demand curve]]
- **Normal price-quantity relationship**: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_1} < 0$
- **Most common** type of good in practice

### Price Offer Curve
For ordinary goods, the [[Price Offer Curve]] slopes downward, connecting optimal bundles that show decreasing $x_1^*$ as $p_1$ increases.

## Giffen Goods

### Definition
If, for **some values** of its own price, the quantity demanded of a good **rises** as its own price **increases**, then the good is called a **Giffen good**.

### Characteristics
- **Upward-sloping segments** in the [[Direct Demand Function|demand curve]]
- **Abnormal price-quantity relationship**: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_1} > 0$ (for some price ranges)
- **Theoretical curiosity** - extremely rare in practice

### Price Offer Curve
For Giffen goods, the [[Price Offer Curve]] can bend backward, creating regions where higher prices lead to higher quantities demanded.

## Mathematical Distinction

For a demand function $x_1^*(p_1, p_2, m)$:

**Ordinary Good**: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_1} < 0$ for all $p_1$

**Giffen Good**: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_1} > 0$ for some values of $p_1$

## Graphical Comparison

### Ordinary Goods
- Demand curve consistently slopes downward
- Price offer curve moves left as price increases
- Standard economic intuition applies

### Giffen Goods  
- Demand curve has **positively sloped portions**
- Price offer curve can bend backward
- Violates standard economic intuition

## Economic Intuition

### Ordinary Goods
Higher prices reduce purchasing power and make the good less attractive relative to substitutes, leading to lower quantity demanded.

### Giffen Goods
For inferior goods that comprise a large portion of the budget, higher prices can create such a strong **income effect** that it overwhelms the **substitution effect**, leading to increased demand.

## Relationship to Income Effects

Giffen behavior typically occurs with:
- **Inferior goods** (demand decreases as income increases)
- Goods representing a **large budget share**
- Limited **substitute availability**
