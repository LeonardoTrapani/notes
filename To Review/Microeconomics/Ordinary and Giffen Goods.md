# Ordinary and Giffen Goods

## Overview
Goods can be classified based on how quantity demanded responds to changes in the good's own price. This classification reveals important insights about consumer behavior and market dynamics.

## Types of Goods by Price Response

### [[Ordinary Goods]]
Goods where quantity demanded always decreases as price increases.
- Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_1} < 0$ for all prices
- Exhibit normal downward-sloping demand curves
- Most common type of good in practice

### [[Giffen Goods]]
Goods where quantity demanded increases as price increases (in some price ranges).
- Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_1} > 0$ for some prices
- Exhibit upward-sloping segments in demand curves
- Extremely rare theoretical curiosity

## Key Differences
| Aspect | Ordinary Goods | Giffen Goods |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Demand curve slope | Always downward | Upward segments possible |
| Price-quantity relationship | Always negative | Positive in some ranges |
| Frequency | Very common | Extremely rare |
| Economic intuition | Follows standard theory | Violates standard assumptions |

## Economic Mechanisms

### Ordinary Goods
- **Income and substitution effects** work in same direction
- Higher prices â†’ lower quantity demanded
- Standard consumer theory applies

### Giffen Goods
- **Income effect overwhelms substitution effect**
- Requires inferior goods with large budget shares
- **Limited substitutes** and **low-income consumers**

## Relationship to Income Classification
- **Giffen goods** are always [[Inferior Goods]]
- **Not all inferior goods** are Giffen goods
- **Ordinary goods** can be either [[Normal Goods|normal]] or [[Inferior Goods|inferior]]
