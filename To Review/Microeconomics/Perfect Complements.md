# Perfect Complements

## Definition  
If a consumer always consumes commodities 1 and 2 in **fixed proportions** (e.g., 1:1, 2:1, or 1:7), then the commodities are **perfect complements**. Only the **number of pairs** of units of the two commodities determines the preference rank-order of bundles.

## Mathematical Characteristics

### Indifference Curve Shape
- **L-shaped curves** with right-angle kinks
- **Horizontal segments**: slope = 0
- **Vertical segments**: slope = ∞ (infinite)  
- **Kink point**: slope undefined

### Marginal Rate of Substitution
- **Zero** on horizontal segments
- **Infinite** on vertical segments
- **Undefined** at the kink points

### Utility Function
For perfect complements with 1:1 consumption:
$$U(x_1, x_2) = \min\{x_1, x_2\}$$

For perfect complements with ratio $a:b$:
$$U(x_1, x_2) = \min\left\{\frac{x_1}{a}, \frac{x_2}{b}\right\}$$

## Economic Examples
- **Tea and sugar** (consumed in fixed proportions)
- **Left and right shoes**  
- **Cars and tires** (4 tires per car)
- **Bread and butter** (for sandwiches)
- **Computer and monitor** (one-to-one pairing)

## Graphical Representation

### Example: Tea and Sugar (1:1 ratio)
- **45° line**: Represents efficient consumption (equal amounts)
- **Kink points**: On the 45° line where $x_1 = x_2$
- **Horizontal segments**: Excess of good 1, more good 2 needed
- **Vertical segments**: Excess of good 2, more good 1 needed

### Key Points
- $(5,5)$, $(5,9)$, and $(9,5)$ all contain **5 complete pairs**
- All equally preferred despite different total quantities
- Only **complete pairs** contribute to utility

## Preference Axiom Analysis

### Axioms Satisfied
1. **Completeness**: ✓ Can compare all bundles
2. **Reflexivity**: ✓ Each bundle as good as itself
3. **Transitivity**: ✓ Consistent ranking

### Axioms Partially Violated
4. **Monotonicity**: ⚠️ Partially violated
   - More of **both goods** is always better
   - More of **only one good** doesn't improve utility beyond the kink
5. **Convexity**: ✓ Technically satisfied (L-shapes are convex)

## Consumer Behavior Implications

### Optimal Consumption
- Always consume at the **kink points**
- Maintain **fixed proportions** regardless of income level
- **No substitution** between goods - excess units provide no additional utility

### Response to Price Changes  
- **Income effects dominate** substitution effects
- **Demand curves** are typically less elastic
- Consumers maintain proportional consumption even when relative prices change

## Historical Note
These "L-shaped" preferences are also known as **Leontief preferences**, named after economist **Wassily Leontief** (1906-1999; Nobel Prize 1973), who developed input-output analysis using similar fixed-proportion assumptions.
