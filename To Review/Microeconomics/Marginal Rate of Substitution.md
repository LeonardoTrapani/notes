# Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)

## Definition
The **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)** is the ratio at which an individual is **willing to trade** one good for another while remaining equally satisfied ("happy").

### Formal Definition
MRS is the **maximum quantity of good $x_2$** the individual is willing to **give up** (trade off) to get **one additional unit of $x_1$** and remain equally satisfied.

## Mathematical Representation
The MRS is the **slope of the indifference curve**:

$$MRS_{x_1, x_2} = \frac{dx_2}{dx_1}$$

**Note**: Some textbooks define MRS as the inverse of the slope (taking the positive value), but following Varian's notation, we use the slope directly.

## Economic Interpretation
The MRS represents:
- **Trade-off willingness**: How much of good 2 a consumer will sacrifice for one more unit of good 1
- **Subjective exchange rate**: The personal rate at which goods can be substituted
- **Preference intensity**: Steeper curves (higher absolute MRS) indicate stronger preference for the horizontal-axis good

## Properties of MRS

### For Well-Behaved Preferences
- **Diminishing MRS**: As we move along an indifference curve (increasing $x_1$, decreasing $x_2$), the absolute value of MRS decreases
- **Negative value**: For normal goods, MRS is negative (downward-sloping indifference curves)

### Mathematical Expression
Between two points on an indifference curve:
- From point $(x_1^a, x_2^a)$ to $(x_1^c, x_2^c)$:

$$MRS = \frac{x_2^c - x_2^a}{x_1^c - x_1^a} = \frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1}$$

## Examples by Preference Type

### [[Perfect Substitutes]]
- **MRS is constant** along each indifference curve
- **Value**: $MRS = -1$ (if goods are 1:1 substitutes)

### [[Perfect Complements]]
- **MRS is zero, infinite, or undefined**
- **Zero** on horizontal segments
- **Infinite** on vertical segments  
- **Undefined** at kinks

### Well-Behaved Preferences
- **Diminishing MRS**: $|MRS|$ decreases as $x_1$ increases
- **Smooth variation**: MRS changes continuously along the curve

## Absolute Value Interpretation
To avoid working with negative numbers:
- Take **absolute value**: $|MRS|$ gives positive trade-off rate
- **Higher absolute MRS** = steeper indifference curve = stronger preference for horizontal good
- **Lower absolute MRS** = flatter indifference curve = weaker preference for horizontal good

## Connection to Consumer Theory
The MRS plays a crucial role in:
- **[[Optimal Consumer Choice]]**: At optimum, MRS equals price ratio
- **[[Demand Function Derivation]]**: Changes in MRS help explain demand curves
- **[[Consumer Equilibrium]]**: Tangency conditions in optimization
