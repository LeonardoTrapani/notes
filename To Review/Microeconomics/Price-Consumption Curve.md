## Price-Consumption Curve

**Definition**: The price-consumption curve traces out all optimal consumption bundles as the price of one good varies, holding the other price and income constant.

### Construction

1. **Fix** the price of good 2 ($p_2$) and income ($m$)
2. **Vary** the price of good 1 ($p_1$) systematically
3. **Find optimal bundle** for each price level using [[Feasibility and Optimality Conditions]]
4. **Connect** all optimal points to form the price-consumption curve

### Relationship to Demand Curves

The price-consumption curve is the **graphical foundation** for deriving [[Marshallian Demand Functions]]:

- **Upper graph**: Shows consumption bundles in $(x_1, x_2)$ space
- **Lower graph**: Shows corresponding demand curve in $(p_1, x_1)$ space
- **Vertical lines** connect corresponding points between graphs

### Curves by Preference Type

#### Cobb-Douglas Preferences
- **Smooth curves** connecting optimal points
- **Constant expenditure shares**: consumer spends fixed proportion of income on each good
- **Example**: For $U = x_1^{1/2}x_2^{1/2}$, always spend half income on each good

#### Perfect Complements  
- **L-shaped segments** reflecting fixed consumption ratios
- **Proportional consumption**: $x_1^* = x_2^*$ always
- **Parallel shifts** as prices change

#### Perfect Substitutes
- **Discontinuous jumps** between corner solutions
- **Either-or consumption**: consume only the relatively cheaper good
- **Horizontal/vertical segments** at corners

#### Quasi-Linear Preferences
- **Mixed curves** showing both interior and corner regions
- **Kinks** where solution type changes from interior to corner
- **Non-parallel shifts** due to income effects varying by good

### Economic Interpretation

#### Substitution Effects
The price-consumption curve shows how consumers **substitute** between goods as relative prices change:
- **Steep curves**: limited substitutability
- **Flat curves**: high substitutability  
- **Kinked curves**: threshold effects in substitution

#### Income Effects  
Changes in $p_1$ affect **real purchasing power**, influencing consumption of both goods:
- **Normal goods**: consumption decreases as effective income falls
- **Inferior goods**: consumption might increase as effective income falls

### Applications

#### Market Analysis
- Predicting consumption changes from price policies
- Understanding consumer responses to taxation
- Analyzing subsidy effects

#### Welfare Economics  
- Measuring consumer surplus changes
- Evaluating policy interventions
- Assessing distributional effects

The price-consumption curve thus provides crucial insights into [[Consumer Preferences]] and forms the foundation for understanding market behavior under [[Market Mechanism]].
