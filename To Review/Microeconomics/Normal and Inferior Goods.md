# Normal and Inferior Goods

## Overview
Goods can be classified based on how demand responds to changes in consumer income. This classification is fundamental to understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics.

## Types of Goods by Income Response

### [[Normal Goods]]
Goods for which quantity demanded rises with income.
- Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} > 0$
- Most consumer goods fall into this category

### [[Inferior Goods]]
Goods for which quantity demanded decreases with income.
- Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} < 0$
- Often lower-quality alternatives abandoned as income rises

## Income Offer Curve Analysis
The classification of goods affects the shape and behavior of the [[Income Offer Curve]]:

- **Both goods normal**: Curve slopes upward and outward
- **One good inferior**: Curve bends backward as income increases

## Income Elasticity Classifications
- **Normal goods**: Positive income elasticity
  - *Necessities*: $0 < \epsilon_m < 1$
  - *Luxuries*: $\epsilon_m > 1$
- **Inferior goods**: Negative income elasticity ($\epsilon_m < 0$)

## Empirical Considerations
- A good's classification can vary across income ranges
- Cultural and regional factors influence these classifications
- Economic development affects the normal/inferior status of goods
