## Normal Goods

### Definition
A good for which quantity demanded **rises with income** is called **normal**.

### Mathematical Condition
$$\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} > 0$$

The demand for normal goods increases when consumer income increases.

### Engel Curve Characteristics
- **Positively sloped** [[Engel Curve]]
- Quantity increases as income increases
- Represents the typical case for most goods

### Economic Examples
- Most consumer goods: food, clothing, entertainment
- Luxury items: jewelry, premium cars
- Services: healthcare, education

## Inferior Goods

### Definition  
A good for which quantity demanded **decreases with income** is called **inferior**.

### Mathematical Condition
$$\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} < 0$$

The demand for inferior goods decreases when consumer income increases.

### Engel Curve Characteristics
- **Negatively sloped** [[Engel Curve]]  
- Quantity decreases as income increases
- Typically occurs at higher income levels

### Economic Examples
- Generic/store-brand products
- Public transportation (vs. private cars)
- Low-quality substitutes that consumers abandon when income rises

## Income Offer Curve Implications

### Both Goods Normal
- [[Income Offer Curve]] slopes upward and outward
- Both consumption quantities increase with income
- Most common scenario

### One Good Inferior
- [[Income Offer Curve]] bends backward  
- Inferior good consumption falls as income rises
- Normal good consumption rises more than proportionally

## Relationship to Good Types

### Normal Goods Classification
1. **Necessities**: $0 < \text{income elasticity} < 1$
2. **Luxuries**: $\text{income elasticity} > 1$

### Inferior Goods
- **Income elasticity} < 0$
- Often lower-quality alternatives

## Mathematical Example

Consider a consumer with preferences where good 1 becomes inferior at high income levels:

If $x_1^* = f(m)$ where $f'(m) < 0$ for $m > m_0$, then good 1 is inferior for incomes above $m_0$.

## Cobb-Douglas Case

For $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b$:

Demands: $x_1^* = \frac{am}{(a+b)p_1}$ and $x_2^* = \frac{bm}{(a+b)p_2}$

Both have $\frac{\partial x_i^*}{\partial m} > 0$, so **both goods are normal** for all income levels.

## Policy Implications

### Normal Goods
- Income growth increases demand
- Relevant for luxury taxes
- Economic development increases consumption

### Inferior Goods  
- Income redistribution affects demand patterns
- Welfare programs may reduce demand
- Economic development may eliminate markets

## Empirical Considerations

### Income Ranges
- A good can be normal in some income ranges and inferior in others
- Classification depends on income level being analyzed
- Aggregate data may mask individual variations
