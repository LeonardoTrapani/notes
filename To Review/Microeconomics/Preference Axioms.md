# Preference Axioms

## Minimum Regularity Assumptions

### 1. Completeness Axiom
**"Always have an answer"**

For any bundles $a$ and $b$, either $a \succsim b$, or $b \succsim a$, or $a \sim b$.

**Economic meaning**: Consumers can always compare and rank any two consumption bundles.

### 2. Reflexivity Axiom  
**"Unless you are a small kid"**

Any bundle $a \succsim a$.

**Economic meaning**: Every bundle is at least as good as itself.

### 3. Transitivity Axiom
**"Avoid contradictory answers"**

If $b \succsim a$ and $c \succsim b$, then $c \succsim a$.

**Economic meaning**: Preferences are logically consistent - no circular preferences.

## Additional Axioms for Well-Behaved Preferences

### 4. Monotonicity Axiom
**"More is better"**

If $x_1^b \geq x_1^a$ and $x_2^b > x_2^a$, then $b \succ a$
**OR**
If $x_1^b > x_1^a$ and $x_2^b \geq x_2^a$, then $b \succ a$

**Economic meaning**: Consumers always prefer bundles with more of at least one good and no less of any other good.

### 5. Convexity Axiom
**"People prefer variety of goods to extremes"**

If $a \sim b$, then for any $0 \leq t \leq 1$:
- $t \cdot a + (1-t) \cdot b \succsim a$
- $t \cdot a + (1-t) \cdot b \succsim b$

**Economic meaning**: Consumers prefer diversified consumption over extreme bundles. Any weighted average of equally preferred bundles is at least as good as the original bundles.

## Implications of Axioms

### What Each Axiom Delivers

1. **Completeness** → Every bundle lies on an indifference curve
2. **Reflexivity** → Self-consistency of preferences  
3. **Transitivity** → [[Indifference Curves]] cannot cross
4. **Monotonicity** → 
   - Indifference curves slope downward for goods
   - Higher indifference curves are preferred
   - Indifference curves cannot be thick
5. **Convexity** → 
   - Indifference curves are convex (bow toward origin)
   - Diminishing [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]]
   - Preference for diversification

## Violations and Special Cases

### When Axioms Are Violated
- **[[Perfect Substitutes]]**: Violate strict convexity
- **[[Perfect Complements]]**: Partially violate monotonicity  
- **[[Concave Indifference Curves]]**: Violate convexity
- **[[Neutral Goods]]**: Violate monotonicity and convexity
- **[[Bad Goods]]**: Violate monotonicity

### Economic Significance
These violations lead to interesting economic phenomena:
- Corner solutions in optimization
- Kinked demand functions  
- Non-standard consumer behavior

## Behavioral Economics Perspective
**Theory vs. Reality**: Real-world individuals may not always satisfy these axioms due to:
- Cognitive limitations
- Psychological biases  
- Social influences
- Bounded rationality

However, these axioms provide a useful **baseline model** for understanding economic behavior and making predictions.
