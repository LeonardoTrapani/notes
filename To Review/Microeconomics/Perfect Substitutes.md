# Perfect Substitutes

## Definition
If a consumer always regards units of commodities 1 and 2 as **equivalent**, then the commodities are **perfect substitutes**. Only the **total amount** of the two commodities in bundles determines their preference rank-order.

## Mathematical Characteristics

### Indifference Curve Shape
- **Straight lines** with constant slope
- All indifference curves are **parallel** to each other

### Marginal Rate of Substitution
- **Constant MRS** for this type of preferences
- Typically $MRS = -1$ for 1:1 substitutes
- Value depends on substitution rate between goods

### Utility Function
For perfect substitutes with 1:1 substitution rate:
$$U(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$$

For perfect substitutes with rate $a:b$:
$$U(x_1, x_2) = ax_1 + bx_2$$

## Economic Examples
- **Sugar and honey** (for sweetening purposes)
- **Different brands** of essentially identical products
- **Pencils with different colors** (for writing)
- **$1 bills and $1 coins**
- **Digital and physical copies** of identical content

## Graphical Representation
Indifference curves are **straight lines** with:
- **Slopes are constant** at $-\frac{a}{b}$ (substitution ratio)
- **Higher lines** represent higher utility levels
- **Parallel lines** indicating consistent substitution rate

### Example: Sugar and Honey
If sugar and honey are 1:1 perfect substitutes:
- **Slope = -1** for all indifference curves
- **$I_2$**: Bundles with total of 15 units
- **$I_1$**: Bundles with total of 8 units
- Consumer **indifferent** between $(8,0)$, $(4,4)$, and $(0,8)$ on $I_1$

## Preference Axiom Analysis

### Axioms Satisfied
1. **Completeness**: ✓ Can compare all bundles
2. **Reflexivity**: ✓ Each bundle as good as itself  
3. **Transitivity**: ✓ Consistent ranking
4. **Monotonicity**: ✓ More total units preferred

### Axiom Violated
5. **Strict Convexity**: ✗ Indifference curves are linear, not strictly convex

### Implications
- **No diminishing MRS**: Substitution rate constant
- **Corner solutions**: Optimal consumption often at extremes
- **No preference for variety**: Indifferent between diversified and extreme bundles

## Consumer Behavior Implications
With perfect substitutes:
- Consumers will typically choose **corner solutions**
- Purchase only the **relatively cheaper** good
- **Switch completely** when relative prices change
- **No interior solutions** unless price ratio equals MRS
