## Definition

The curve containing all utility-maximizing bundles traced out as income $m$ changes, with both prices $p_1$ and $p_2$ held constant.

## Construction

1. Fix both prices: $p_1$ and $p_2$ constant
2. Vary income levels: $m' < m'' < m'''$
3. Find the optimal consumption bundle at each income level
4. Connect these optimal points to form the income offer curve

## Mathematical Representation

The income offer curve shows the relationship between optimal consumption bundles $(x_1^*, x_2^*)$ as $m$ varies, subject to:
- Budget constraints: $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$ (for each income level)
- Utility maximization conditions

## Shape Characteristics

### Both Goods Normal
- Income offer curve slopes **upward and outward**  
- Both $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$ increase with income
- Most common case

### One Good Inferior
- Income offer curve can **bend backward**
- Inferior good consumption decreases as income rises
- Normal good consumption increases more than proportionally

## Relationship to Engel Curves

The income offer curve is directly related to [[Engel Curve|Engel curves]]:
- **$x_1$-coordinates** of income offer curve points → Engel curve for good 1
- **$x_2$-coordinates** of income offer curve points → Engel curve for good 2

## Example: Cobb-Douglas Preferences

For utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b$:

Demand functions:
- $x_1^* = \frac{am}{(a+b)p_1}$
- $x_2^* = \frac{bm}{(a+b)p_2}$

Income offer curve: Linear relationship between $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$
$$\frac{x_2^*}{x_1^*} = \frac{bp_1}{ap_2} = \text{constant}$$

## Applications

### Consumer Theory
- Understanding how consumption patterns change with wealth
- Income elasticity analysis
- Luxury vs. necessity classification

### Policy Analysis  
- Effects of income transfers on consumption
- Progressive taxation impacts
- Welfare program design

## Comparison to Price Offer Curve

| Aspect | Income Offer Curve | [[Price Offer Curve]] |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Variable** | Income $(m)$ | Price $(p_1)$ |
| **Constants** | $p_1, p_2$ | $p_2, m$ |
| **Generates** | [[Engel Curve]] | [[Direct Demand Function]] |
