# Opportunity Cost

## Definition
**Opportunity cost** is the value of the best alternative foregone when making a choice. In consumer theory, it represents the trade-offs inherent in resource allocation decisions.

## In Budget Constraint Analysis
The **slope of the budget constraint** measures the opportunity cost of good $x_1$ with respect to good $x_2$.

### Mathematical Expression  
For the budget constraint $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$:

**Slope** = $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$

### Economic Interpretation
- **Opportunity cost of one additional unit of good 1**: $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ units of good 2 must be foregone
- **Opportunity cost of one additional unit of good 2**: $\frac{p_2}{p_1}$ units of good 1 must be foregone

## Practical Example
Consider Jannik's budget:
- **Income**: €1000  
- **Price of jeans** ($p_1$): €100
- **Price of watches** ($p_2$): €200

### Calculations
- **Slope**: $-\frac{100}{200} = -0.5$
- **Opportunity cost of jeans**: $\frac{100}{200} = 0.5$ watches per pair of jeans
- **Opportunity cost of watches**: $\frac{200}{100} = 2$ pairs of jeans per watch

### Interpretation
- To buy **one more pair of jeans**, Jannik must give up **0.5 watches**
- To buy **one more watch**, Jannik must give up **2 pairs of jeans**

## Economic Significance

### Resource Scarcity
Opportunity cost reflects the fundamental economic problem of **scarcity**:
- Limited income forces choices between alternatives
- Every consumption decision involves trade-offs
- Prices provide information about relative scarcity

### Decision-Making Framework
Rational consumers consider opportunity costs when:
- **Comparing alternatives**: Evaluate what must be given up
- **Assessing value**: Determine if benefits exceed opportunity costs
- **Making optimal choices**: Allocate resources to highest-valued uses

### Connection to Marginal Analysis
Opportunity cost links to:
- **[[Marginal Rate of Substitution]]**: Personal trade-off willingness
- **[[Consumer Equilibrium]]**: Optimal when MRS equals price ratio
- **[[Demand Theory]]**: How consumers respond to changing opportunity costs

## Beyond Consumer Theory
The opportunity cost concept applies broadly to:
- **Production decisions**: Alternative uses of inputs
- **Investment choices**: Returns foregone on alternative investments  
- **Time allocation**: Activities foregone when choosing how to spend time
- **Policy analysis**: Social costs of government spending decisions
