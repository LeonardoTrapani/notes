## Definition

**Marginal utility** of good $x_i$ is the change in utility an individual gets from consuming one more or one less unit of good $x_i$.

## Mathematical Representation

### For Discrete Changes
$$MU_{x_i} = \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta x_i}$$

### For Small (Infinitesimal) Changes
$$MU_{x_i} = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i}$$

The marginal utility is the **slope** of the [[Utility Functions|utility function]] with respect to good $x_i$.

## Relationship to Marginal Rate of Substitution

The [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] can be expressed in terms of marginal utilities:

$$MRS = -\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}}$$

### Derivation
On the same [[Indifference Curves|indifference curve]]:
- Infinitesimal variations: $MU_{x_1} dx_1 + MU_{x_2} dx_2 = 0$
- Rearranging: $\frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = -\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}}$
- Since $MRS = \frac{dx_2}{dx_1}$, we get: $MRS = -\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}}$

## Example: Cobb-Douglas Utility

For $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 x_2$:

$$MU_{x_1} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} = x_2$$

$$MU_{x_2} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = x_1$$

Therefore:
$$MRS = -\frac{x_2}{x_1}$$

## Economic Interpretation

Marginal utility represents the **additional satisfaction** gained from consuming one more unit of a good, holding consumption of other goods constant. It provides the foundation for understanding:
- Consumer choice decisions
- Trade-offs between goods
- The slope of indifference curves through the MRS relationship
