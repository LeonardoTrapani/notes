## Definition

A **utility function** is the relationship between utility measures and every possible bundle of goods. It assigns numerical values that reflect the relative rankings of various bundles of goods.

## Mathematical Representation

A utility function $u(x)$ represents a [[Consumer Preferences|preference relation]] if and only if:

- $a \succeq b \Leftrightarrow u(a) \geq u(b)$
- $a \succ b \Leftrightarrow u(a) > u(b)$
- $a \sim b \Leftrightarrow u(a) = u(b)$

## Key Properties

### Ordinal Nature
Following **Vilfredo Pareto's approach** (1848-1923), utility functions summarize **ordinal information**:
- The scale chosen for the utility function is arbitrary
- Only the ranking matters, not the absolute values
- If $u(a) = 6$ and $u(b) = 2$, then bundle $a$ is strictly preferred to bundle $b$, but $a$ is **not** preferred three times as much as $b$

### Non-Uniqueness
There is **no unique utility function representation** of a preference relation. Any [[Monotonic Transformations|monotonic transformation]] $V = f(u)$ where $f$ is strictly increasing represents the same preferences.

## Relationship to Indifference Curves

- All bundles on an [[Indifference Curves|indifference curve]] have the same utility level
- Equal preference $\Rightarrow$ same utility level
- The complete collection of indifference curves (an **indifference map**) is equivalent to a utility function

## Connection to Consumer Choice

Utility functions provide a solution to the problem of comparing infinite bundles on the real plane and choosing the "best alternative" among available options, making the analysis of [[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]] more computationally manageable.
