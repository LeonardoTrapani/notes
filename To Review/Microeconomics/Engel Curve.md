## Definition

A plot of quantity demanded against income is called an **Engel curve**.

## Mathematical Form

For good 1: $x_1^* = f(m | p_1, p_2)$

Where:
- $x_1^*$ = quantity demanded of good 1
- $m$ = income  
- $p_1, p_2$ = held constant (both prices fixed)

## Construction from Income Offer Curve

The Engel curve is derived from the [[Income Offer Curve]]:
1. Take each point on the income offer curve: $(x_1^*(m'), x_2^*(m'))$
2. Extract coordinates: $x_1^*(m')$ or $x_2^*(m')$  
3. Plot against corresponding income level $m'$
4. The resulting curve is the Engel curve

## Types by Good Classification

### Normal Goods
- **Positively sloped** Engel curve
- $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} > 0$
- Quantity demanded increases with income

### Inferior Goods  
- **Negatively sloped** Engel curve
- $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} < 0$
- Quantity demanded decreases with income

## Cobb-Douglas Example

For utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b$:

### Demand Functions
- $x_1^* = \frac{am}{(a+b)p_1}$
- $x_2^* = \frac{bm}{(a+b)p_2}$

### Engel Curves
Rearranging to isolate $m$:

**Good 1**: $m = \frac{(a+b)p_1}{a} x_1^*$

**Good 2**: $m = \frac{(a+b)p_2}{b} x_2^*$

Both are **linear** and **positively sloped** â†’ both goods are normal.

## Economic Interpretation

### Slope Interpretation
- **Steep positive slope**: Luxury good (high income elasticity)
- **Gentle positive slope**: Necessity (low income elasticity)  
- **Negative slope**: Inferior good

### Income Elasticity
The Engel curve slope is related to income elasticity:
$$\epsilon_m = \frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial m} \cdot \frac{m}{x_1^*}$$

## Applications

### Consumer Analysis
- Understanding consumption patterns across income levels
- Forecasting demand changes with economic growth
- Market segmentation strategies

### Policy Applications  
- Progressive taxation effects
- Income redistribution impacts
- Welfare program targeting

## Graphical Properties

### Normal Good Engel Curve
- **Upward sloping** from origin
- Can be linear (Cobb-Douglas) or curved
- Shows increasing consumption with income

### Inferior Good Engel Curve
- **Downward sloping** for some income ranges
- Typically occurs at higher income levels
- Shows decreasing consumption with income
