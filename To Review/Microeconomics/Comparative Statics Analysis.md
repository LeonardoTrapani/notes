## Definition

Comparative statics analysis of ordinary demand functions is the study of how ordinary demands change as parameters change.

For a two-good economy with demand functions:
- $x_1^*(p_1, p_2, m)$
- $x_2^*(p_1, p_2, m)$

The analysis examines how these demands change when:
- **Own prices** $(p_1, p_2)$ change
- **Income** $(m)$ changes

## Types of Comparative Statics

### 1. Own-Price Changes
How does $x_1^*(p_1, p_2, m)$ change as $p_1$ changes, holding $p_2$ and $m$ constant?

This leads to:
- [[Price Offer Curve]]
- [[Direct Demand Function]]
- [[Inverse Demand Function]]

### 2. Cross-Price Changes  
How does $x_1^*(p_1, p_2, m)$ change as $p_2$ changes, holding $p_1$ and $m$ constant?

This determines whether goods are:
- [[Gross Substitutes and Complements]]

### 3. Income Changes
How does $x_1^*(p_1, p_2, m)$ change as $m$ changes, holding both $p_1$ and $p_2$ constant?

This leads to:
- [[Income Offer Curve]]
- [[Engel Curve]]
- Classification as [[Normal and Inferior Goods]]

## Significance

Comparative statics analysis is fundamental to understanding consumer behavior and forms the theoretical foundation for deriving [[Market Mechanism|demand curves]] used in market analysis.
