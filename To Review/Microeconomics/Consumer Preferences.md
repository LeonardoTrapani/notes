# Consumer Preferences

## Two Approaches to Modeling Preferences
1. **[[Indifference Curves]]** (geometric approach)
2. **[[Utility Functions]]** (analytical approach)

*Approach developed by Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923)*

## Preference Relations

### Mathematical Notation
- **$\succ$** : Strict preference (e.g., consumer strictly prefers bundle $a$ to bundle $b$)
- **$\sim$** : Indifference (e.g., consumer is indifferent between $a$ and $b$)  
- **$\succsim$** : Weak preference (consumer either prefers $a$ to $b$, or is indifferent)

## Regularity Axioms for Preferences

### Minimum Set of Axioms
1. **[[Completeness Axiom]]**: "Always have an answer"
2. **[[Reflexivity Axiom]]**: Any bundle is at least as good as itself  
3. **[[Transitivity Axiom]]**: "Avoid contradictory answers"

### Well-Behaved Preferences
Additional axioms for tractable economic analysis:

4. **[[Monotonicity Axiom]]**: "More is better"
5. **[[Convexity Axiom]]**: "People prefer variety to extremes"

## Properties of Well-Behaved Preferences
When preferences satisfy all five axioms, they yield:

1. **Higher indifference curves preferred** to lower ones
2. **Every bundle lies on an indifference curve**  
3. **Indifference curves cannot cross**
4. **Indifference curves slope downward** for goods
5. **Indifference curves cannot be thick**
6. **[[Indifference Curves are Convex]]**

## Special Cases - Violations of Axioms

### [[Perfect Substitutes]]
- **Axiom violated**: Strict convexity
- **Characteristics**: Straight-line indifference curves, constant [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]]

### [[Perfect Complements]] 
- **Axiom violated**: Monotonicity (partially)
- **Characteristics**: L-shaped indifference curves, fixed proportions consumption

### [[Concave Indifference Curves]]
- **Axiom violated**: Convexity
- **Characteristics**: Individuals prefer NOT to diversify consumption

### [[Neutral Goods]]
- **Axioms violated**: Monotonicity and convexity
- **Characteristics**: Horizontal or vertical indifference curves

### [[Bad Goods]]
- **Axiom violated**: Monotonicity  
- **Characteristics**: Positively-sloped indifference curves

## Economic Significance
Consumer preferences, combined with [[Budget Constraints]], determine:
- **What consumers WANT** to purchase
- **How consumers rank** different consumption bundles
- **Trade-offs consumers are willing** to make between goods
