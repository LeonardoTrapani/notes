## Definitions

### Ordinal Information
- **Ordinal information** only tells us **if** one alternative is better or worse than another
- Provides ranking without magnitude of difference
- Example: Bundle A is preferred to Bundle B

### Cardinal Information  
- **Cardinal information** tells us **how much** better or worse one alternative is with respect to another
- Provides both ranking and magnitude of difference
- Example: Bundle A provides twice as much satisfaction as Bundle B

## Standard Economic Assumption

In microeconomic theory, we assume that [[Utility Functions|utility functions]] summarize **ordinal information**:

- The scale we choose for the utility function is **arbitrary**
- It does not change the underlying [[Consumer Preferences|preferences]]
- Only the **ordering** of bundles matters, not absolute utility values

## Implications

### Mathematical Example
If $u(a) = 6$ and $u(b) = 2$:
- Bundle $a$ is **strictly preferred** to bundle $b$
- Bundle $a$ is **NOT** preferred three times as much as bundle $b$
- The ratio of utility values has no meaningful interpretation

### Transformation Invariance
Since utility is ordinal, any [[Monotonic Transformations|strictly increasing transformation]] preserves the preference ordering:
- $V = u^2$ represents the same preferences as $u$
- $W = 2u + 10$ represents the same preferences as $u$

## Historical Context

This approach is due to **Vilfredo Pareto** (1848-1923), who established that utility functions should be understood as representing ordinal rankings rather than cardinal measurements of satisfaction.
