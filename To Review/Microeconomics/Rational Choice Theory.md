# Rational Choice Theory

## Behavioral Postulate
**Rational choice theory** assumes that individuals choose in a "rational way" by maximizing their well-being subject to scarcity and trade-offs.

## Decision Process
The rational choice framework involves two sequential steps:

### 1. Identify Feasible Alternatives
Determine the **set of feasible alternatives** - all options that are actually available given constraints.

### 2. Choose the Best Alternative
Select the **optimal alternative** from among those that are feasible.

## Mathematical Framework
A decision maker always chooses their **most preferred alternative** from their set of **available alternatives**.

## Modeling Requirements
To understand and model choice behavior, economists must model the decision maker's [[Consumer Preferences|preferences]].

### Dual Determinants of Demand
Consumer demand is determined by two key factors:
- **[[Budget Constraints]]**: Determine what I **CAN** purchase (feasible set)
- **[[Consumer Preferences]]**: Determine what I **WANT** to purchase (preference ordering)

## Consumption Bundles
Mathematically, consumption choices are represented as **consumption bundles**:

$$x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n)$$

Where $x_i$ indicates the units of good $i$ an individual chooses/consumes.

For graphical analysis, economists typically assume two commodities: $x_1$ and $x_2$.

**Important**: Analysis with two goods can be extended to $n$ goods.
