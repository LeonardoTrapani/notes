## Marshallian Demand Functions

**Definition**: Marshallian demand functions (also called **direct demand functions**) are the optimal consumption choices that result from solving the constrained utility maximization problem:

$$\max_{x_1, x_2} U(x_1, x_2) \text{ subject to } p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$$

The solution yields demand functions of the form:
- $x_1^*(p_1, p_2, m)$
- $x_2^*(p_1, p_2, m)$

### Key Properties

#### Utility Maximizing
These functions represent the quantities that maximize utility given prices and income constraints.

#### Price and Income Dependence
The demanded quantities depend on:
- **Own price** ($p_1$ for good 1, $p_2$ for good 2)
- **Cross price** (price of the other good)
- **Income** ($m$)

#### Relationship to Preferences
Different [[Utility Functions]] generate different demand function forms, but [[Monotonic Transformations]] of the same preferences yield identical demand functions.

### Graphical Derivation

Marshallian demand curves can be derived graphically by:
1. Varying the price of one good (e.g., $p_1$)
2. Keeping the other price ($p_2$) and income ($m$) constant
3. Observing how the optimal quantity changes
4. Plotting price vs. quantity relationships

This process traces out the **price-consumption curve** in the upper graph and the **demand curve** in the lower graph.

### Demand Curve Shapes by Preference Type

#### Cobb-Douglas
- Smooth, downward-sloping curves
- Constant expenditure shares
- $x_1(p_1, p_2, m) = \frac{\alpha m}{p_1}$ where $\alpha$ is the preference parameter

#### Perfect Complements
- Vertical segments in demand curves
- Fixed consumption ratios
- Both goods demanded in constant proportions

#### Perfect Substitutes
- Discontinuous demand curves
- Either-or consumption patterns
- Horizontal segments where goods are equally preferred

### Relationship to Other Concepts

Marshallian demand functions are fundamental to:
- [[Consumer Preferences|Consumer theory]]
- [[Market Mechanism|Market analysis]]
- Price elasticity calculations
- Welfare analysis

They differ from **Hicksian demand functions** (compensated demand), which hold utility constant rather than income.
