## Definition

A utility function representing [[Perfect Complements|perfect complements]] has the form:
$$W(x_1, x_2) = \min\{x_1, x_2\}$$

More generally:
$$u(x_1, x_2) = \min\{ax_1, bx_2\}$$
where $a, b > 0$.

## Characteristics

### Perfect Complementarity  
- Goods must be consumed in **fixed proportions**
- Additional units of one good provide **no additional utility** unless accompanied by proportional amounts of the other good
- Example: left shoes and right shoes, coffee and sugar

### Indifference Curves
- **Right-angled** (L-shaped)
- Vertices lie on a ray from the origin
- Horizontal and vertical segments
- For the basic form, vertices occur where $x_1 = x_2$ (45° line)

## Mathematical Properties

### Utility Determination
The utility equals the **minimum** of the two quantities:
- If $x_1 < x_2$: utility = $x_1$ 
- If $x_1 > x_2$: utility = $x_2$
- If $x_1 = x_2$: utility = $x_1 = x_2$

### Marginal Rate of Substitution
The MRS is:
- **0** on horizontal segments (excess of $x_2$)
- **$-\infty$** on vertical segments (excess of $x_1$)  
- **Undefined** at the corner points

## Indifference Curve Examples

For $W(x_1, x_2) = \min\{x_1, x_2\}$:
- $\min\{x_1, x_2\} = 3$: L-shaped curve with corner at $(3,3)$
- $\min\{x_1, x_2\} = 5$: L-shaped curve with corner at $(5,5)$
- $\min\{x_1, x_2\} = 8$: L-shaped curve with corner at $(8,8)$

All vertices lie on the 45° line from the origin.

## Economic Interpretation

Perfect complements utility applies when:
- Goods must be used together in fixed ratios
- Excess of one good provides no additional satisfaction
- Production technologies require fixed input proportions
- Consumer preferences exhibit no substitutability between goods

### Optimal Consumption
Consumers always choose bundles at the **corner points** where goods are consumed in the optimal fixed proportion, as consuming excess of either good wastes resources without increasing utility.
