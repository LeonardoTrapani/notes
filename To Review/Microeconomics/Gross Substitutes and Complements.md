## Definition

The classification of goods based on how the demand for one good responds to changes in the price of another good.

For goods 1 and 2, if an increase in $p_2$:

## Gross Substitutes

**Increases** demand for commodity 1 → commodity 1 is a **gross substitute** for commodity 2.

Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_2} > 0$

### Economic Intuition
- When good 2 becomes more expensive, consumers switch to good 1
- The goods can **replace each other** in consumption
- Example: Coffee and tea, butter and margarine

### Demand Curve Shifts
When $p_2$ increases for gross substitutes:
- Demand curve for good 1 **shifts outward**
- At any given $p_1$, more of good 1 is demanded

## Gross Complements  

**Reduces** demand for commodity 1 → commodity 1 is a **gross complement** for commodity 2.

Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_2} < 0$

### Economic Intuition
- When good 2 becomes more expensive, demand for good 1 also falls
- The goods are **consumed together**
- Example: Cars and gasoline, printers and ink cartridges

### Demand Curve Shifts
When $p_2$ increases for gross complements:
- Demand curve for good 1 **shifts inward**
- At any given $p_1$, less of good 1 is demanded

## Unrelated Goods

No change in demand for commodity 1 → goods are **unrelated**.

Mathematical condition: $\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_2} = 0$

## Mathematical Example

Consider the demand function:
$$x_1^* = \frac{m}{p_1 + p_2}$$

Taking the partial derivative:
$$\frac{\partial x_1^*}{\partial p_2} = -\frac{m}{(p_1 + p_2)^2} < 0$$

Therefore, commodity 2 is a **gross complement** for commodity 1.

## Graphical Analysis

### Gross Complements Example
- Original demand curve for good 1
- When $p_2$ decreases → demand curve shifts **outward**
- Consumer demands more of both $x_1$ and $x_2$

## Symmetry Property

The relationship is generally **symmetric**:
- If good 1 is a gross substitute for good 2
- Then good 2 is typically a gross substitute for good 1

However, the **magnitude** of cross-price effects may differ.

## Applications

### Market Analysis
- Predicting demand changes when related product prices change
- Pricing strategies for product portfolios
- Market definition in antitrust analysis

### Consumer Theory
- Understanding consumption bundles
- Welfare effects of price changes
