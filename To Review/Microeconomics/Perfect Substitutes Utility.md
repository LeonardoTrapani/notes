## Definition

A utility function representing [[Perfect Substitutes|perfect substitutes]] has the form:
$$V(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$$

More generally:
$$u(x_1, x_2) = ax_1 + bx_2$$
where $a, b > 0$.

## Characteristics

### Perfect Substitutability
- Goods can be substituted at a **constant rate**
- Consumer is indifferent between different combinations as long as the total "units" remain the same
- One unit of $x_1$ can always be exchanged for one unit of $x_2$ (in the basic form)

### Indifference Curves
- **Linear and parallel** lines
- All have the same slope
- Never intersect
- Higher lines represent higher utility levels

## Mathematical Properties

### Marginal Utilities
$$MU_{x_1} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} = a$$

$$MU_{x_2} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = b$$

### Marginal Rate of Substitution
$$MRS = -\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = -\frac{a}{b}$$

For the basic form $V(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$:
$$MRS = -1$$

### Key Property
The MRS is **constant** along all indifference curves and at all points, reflecting the perfect substitutability.

## Examples of Indifference Curves

For $V(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$:
- $x_1 + x_2 = 5$ (utility level 5)
- $x_1 + x_2 = 9$ (utility level 9) 
- $x_1 + x_2 = 13$ (utility level 13)

All have slope = -1.

## Economic Applications

Perfect substitutes utility applies when:
- Goods are essentially identical (different brands of identical products)
- Consumer has no preference between the goods except for price
- Corner solutions are common in optimization problems
- The rate of substitution between goods is fixed by technology or preferences
