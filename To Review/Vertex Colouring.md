A proper vertex colouring of a graph is an assignment of colours to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.

The minimum number of colours needed for a proper vertex colouring is the [[Chromatic Number]] $\chi(G)$.

**Applications:**
- Exam scheduling (vertices = exams, edges = conflicts)
- Register allocation in compilers
- Map coloring problems
