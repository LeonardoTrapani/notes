## Well-Behaved Preferences

### Complete Set of Axioms
Well-behaved preferences satisfy all five axioms:

#### Basic Axioms
1. **[[Regularity Axioms for Preferences#1. Completeness|Completeness]]** ("always have an answer")
2. **[[Regularity Axioms for Preferences#2. Reflexivity|Reflexivity]]** (... unless you are a small kid)  
3. **[[Regularity Axioms for Preferences#3. Transitivity|Transitivity]]** ("avoid contradictory answers")

#### Additional Axioms

#### 4. (Strict) Monotonicity ("more is better")
If $x_1^b \geq x_1^a$ and $x_2^b > x_2^a$, then $b \succ a$

**or**

If $x_1^b > x_1^a$ and $x_2^b \geq x_2^a$, then $b \succ a$

**Meaning**: Having more of at least one good (with no less of the other) is always preferred.

#### 5. Convexity ("people prefer variety of goods to extremes")
If $a \sim b$, then for any $0 \leq t \leq 1$:
- $t \cdot a + (1-t) \cdot b \succeq a$
- $t \cdot a + (1-t) \cdot b \succeq b$

**Meaning**: Any weighted average (mixture) of two equally preferred bundles is at least as good as either bundle alone.

### Implications
These axioms ensure that [[Indifference Curves]] have specific well-defined properties that make economic analysis tractable.
