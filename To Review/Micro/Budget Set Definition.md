### Definition
The **budget set** identifies the set of **all** bundles that an individual can afford to buy (either I spend all my income or not).

### Determinants
The budget set is determined by:
- An individual's (disposable) **income** $m$
- The **price vector** $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n)$

### Mathematical Formulation
$$B(p_1, \ldots, p_n, m) = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) | x_1 \geq 0, \ldots, x_n \geq 0$$
$$\text{and } p_1x_1 + \ldots + p_nx_n \leq m\}$$

### Key Characteristic
The budget set includes all combinations where:
- All quantities are non-negative
- Total expenditure does not exceed income
