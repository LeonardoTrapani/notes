Consider the utility function:

$$W(x_1, x_2) = \min\{x_1, x_2\}$$

This utility function represents two goods that are **perfect complements**.

## Indifference Curve Properties

Screenshot from the resource recommended at page 47

Perfect complements have distinctive L-shaped indifference curves:
- **All are right-angled** with vertices on a ray from the origin
- **Vertical and horizontal segments** only
- **45-degree ray** contains all the "kink" points where $x_1 = x_2$

### Examples of Indifference Curves
- $\min\{x_1, x_2\} = 3$ 
- $\min\{x_1, x_2\} = 5$
- $\min\{x_1, x_2\} = 8$

## Mathematical Properties

### Utility Function Behavior
- When $x_1 < x_2$: utility = $x_1$
- When $x_1 > x_2$: utility = $x_2$  
- When $x_1 = x_2$: utility = $x_1 = x_2$

### Marginal Rate of Substitution
- **Along vertical segments**: MRS = 0 (no willingness to trade $x_2$ for $x_1$)
- **Along horizontal segments**: MRS = $-\infty$ (infinite willingness to trade $x_2$ for $x_1$)
- **At the kink**: MRS is undefined (discontinuous)
  
## Economic Interpretation

### Perfect Complementarity
- Goods **must be consumed together** in fixed proportions (1:1 in this case)
- **No benefit** from having more of one good without more of the other
- **Optimal consumption** always occurs where $x_1 = x_2$

### Fixed Proportions Consumption
- Having $(5,3)$ gives same utility as $(3,3)$ - the extra 2 units of $x_1$ are useless
- Having $(3,8)$ gives same utility as $(3,3)$ - the extra 5 units of $x_2$ are wasted
- Only at $(3,3)$, $(5,5)$, $(8,8)$, etc. are both goods fully utilized

## General Form
More generally: $U(x_1, x_2) = \min\{ax_1, bx_2\}$ where optimal consumption has $ax_1 = bx_2$.

## Examples in Real Life
- Left and right shoes
- Computer hardware and software that must match
- Coffee and sugar (for some consumers)
- Cars and tires (in specific ratios)

## Implications for Consumer Choice
With perfect complements:
- Consumer **always chooses corner of the L** (the kink point)
- Consumption follows **fixed proportions**
- **No substitution** occurs regardless of price changes
- Only **income effects** matter for demand

This extreme case contrasts with [[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function]] where only one good may be consumed, and [[Cobb-Douglas Utility Function]] where smooth substitution occurs.
