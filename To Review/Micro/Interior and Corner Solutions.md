Consumer choice problems can result in two distinct types of optimal solutions: **interior solutions** and **corner solutions**, which differ based on whether the consumer chooses positive quantities of all goods.

## Interior Solutions

**Definition**: An optimal bundle $x^*$ is an interior solution if the individual chooses both commodities:
$$x_1^* > 0 \text{ and } x_2^* > 0$$

### Conditions for Interior Solutions
For well-behaved preferences ([[Well-Behaved Preferences]]), interior solutions must satisfy:

1. **Feasibility condition**: $p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$
2. **Optimality condition** (tangency): $MRS(x^*) = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$

The optimality condition states that at the optimal bundle, "how much I MUST trade off" (price ratio) coincides with "how much I WANT to trade off" ([[Marginal Rate of Substitution]]).

### Economic Interpretation
At the optimal interior solution, the [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] equals the price ratio:
$$MRS(x^*) = \frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$$

This can be rearranged to show that marginal utility per euro spent is equated across commodities:
$$\frac{MU_{x_1}}{p_1} = \frac{MU_{x_2}}{p_2}$$

## Corner Solutions

**Definition**: An optimal bundle $x^*$ is a corner solution if the individual chooses only one of the two goods:
- $x_1^* > 0$ and $x_2^* = 0$, or  
- $x_1^* = 0$ and $x_2^* > 0$

### Conditions for Corner Solutions
Corner solutions satisfy:

1. **Feasibility condition**: $p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$
2. **Optimality condition**: 
   - If $x_1^* > 0$ and $x_2^* = 0$: $MRS(x^*) \geq \frac{p_1}{p_2}$
   - If $x_1^* = 0$ and $x_2^* > 0$: $MRS(x^*) \leq \frac{p_1}{p_2}$

## Preference Types and Solution Types

### Always Interior Solutions
- [[Cobb-Douglas Utility Function]] - with tangency condition
- [[Perfect Complements Utility Function]] - without tangency condition (kinked indifference curves)

### Always Corner Solutions  
- [[Goods Bads and Neutral Commodities]] (neutral goods)
- Concave preferences (addiction-type behavior)

### Mixed Solutions (Interior or Corner)
- [[Quasi-Linear Utility Function]]
- [[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function]]
