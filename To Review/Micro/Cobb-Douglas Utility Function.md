Any utility function of the form:

$$u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b$$

where $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, is called a **"Cobb-Douglas" utility function**.

## Examples

$$u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2} \quad (a = b = 1/2)$$

$$V(x_1, x_2) = x_1 x_2^3 \quad (a = 1, b = 3)$$

## Key Properties

### Well-Behaved Preferences
Cobb-Douglas [[Indifference Curves]] are always **well-behaved** (convex, monotonic) and satisfy all 5 axioms of rational preferences.

### Marginal Rate of Substitution
For the simple case $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 x_2$:
- $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} = x_2$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = x_1$
- Therefore: $\text{MRS} = -\frac{x_2}{x_1}$

Cobb-Douglas indifference curves:
- Are hyperbolic in shape
- Never touch the axes (both goods always needed)
- Show diminishing [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] 
- Are convex to the origin

## Mathematical Advantages

Cobb-Douglas functions are popular in economic modeling because they:
- Provide closed-form solutions for optimization problems
- Have constant expenditure shares in equilibrium
- Allow for easy calibration with real data
- Maintain well-behaved properties under [[Monotonic Transformation of Utility Functions]]

## Relationship to Other Utility Types

Cobb-Douglas functions represent preferences between the extreme cases of:
- [[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function]] (linear indifference curves)
- [[Perfect Complements Utility Function]] (L-shaped indifference curves)

They capture the typical case where goods are neither perfect substitutes nor perfect complements.
