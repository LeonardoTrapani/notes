## Optimality Conditions for Interior Solutions

### Definition of Interior Solution
An optimal bundle $x^* = (x_1^*, x_2^*)$ is an **interior solution** if the individual chooses both commodities:
$$x_1^* > 0 \text{ and } x_2^* > 0$$

### Two Required Conditions

#### 1. Feasibility Condition
The optimal bundle must lie on the [[Budget Constraint Definition|budget constraint]]:
$$p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$$

#### 2. Optimality Condition (Tangency)
At the optimal bundle, the [[Indifference Curves|indifference curve]] and budget constraint must be **tangent**:

$$MRS(x^*) = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$$

### Alternative Formulations

#### In Terms of Marginal Utilities
$$\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$$

#### Marginal Utility per Euro
Rearranging the optimality condition:
$$\frac{MU_{x_1}}{p_1} = \frac{MU_{x_2}}{p_2}$$

### Economic Intuition

#### Budget Constraint Interpretation  
The budget constraint tells the individual how many units of commodity 2 he/she **must give up** to consume one more unit of commodity 1: $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$

#### Indifference Curve Interpretation
The [[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]] tells the individual how many units of commodity 2 he/she **is willing to give up** to obtain one more unit of commodity 1 while remaining equally happy.

#### Equilibrium Condition
At the optimal bundle: "how much I MUST trade off" = "how much I WANT to trade off"

### Exception: Non-Differentiable Preferences
For preferences like [[Perfect Complements Utility Function|perfect complements]] with kinked indifference curves, the tangency condition may not apply, but the economic principle still holds.

### Applications
- [[Cobb-Douglas Demand Functions|Cobb-Douglas preferences]] (always satisfy tangency)
- [[Perfect Complements Demand Functions|Perfect complements]] (satisfy equality condition without tangency)
