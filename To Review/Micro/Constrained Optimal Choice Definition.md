A **constrained optimal choice** represents the fundamental decision-making concept in consumer theory, combining the constraints of limited resources with the objective of utility maximization.

## Definition

A bundle of commodities $x^* = (x_1^*, x_2^*)$ is an **optimal bundle** if, given the individual's income and the prices of the commodities:

1. **Feasibility Condition**: The individual can afford to purchase this bundle ([[Budget Set Definition]])
2. **Optimality Condition**: The individual will not change this bundle with any other bundles because this bundle maximizes his/her utility

## Economic Interpretation

This definition embodies the **behavioral postulate** from [[Rational Choice Theory]]: a decision maker always chooses his or her most preferred alternative from the set of available alternatives.

## Two-Step Process

Economic theory tells us that individuals choose in a "rational way" by:

1. First identifying the set of affordable alternatives ([[Budget Set Definition]]) among those available
2. Given their [[Preference Relations]], they choose "the best" alternative among those affordable

## Connection to Utility Theory

The constrained optimal choice problem can be stated mathematically as:

$$\max_{x_1,x_2} U(x_1, x_2)$$
$$\text{subject to } p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$$

This connects directly to [[Utility Function Definition]] and [[Budget Constraint Definition]].
