### Definition
MRS is the ratio at which the individual is **willing to trade/exchange** one good with the other and remain equally "happy."

It is the **maximum quantity** of good $x_2$ the individual is willing to **give up** (trade off) in order to get one additional unit of $x_1$ and remain equally "happy."

### Mathematical Expression
**MRS is the slope of the indifference curve** $I$:

$$MRS_{x_1, x_2} = \frac{dx_2}{dx_1}$$

**Note**: Some textbooks define the MRS as the inverse of the slope (taking the positive value), but we follow Varian's notation.

### Economic Interpretation
The MRS represents the **rate of trade-off** between goods that keeps the consumer on the same indifference curve.

### Slope Calculation
Under the [[Well-Behaved Preferences#4. (Strict) Monotonicity|monotonicity axiom]], the slope of $I$ is always **negative**.

### Working with Absolute Values
If you prefer working with positive numbers:
- Take the **absolute value** to obtain the MRS as a positive number
- Compare different MRS values along the indifference curve using absolute values
- A higher absolute MRS means the indifference curve is steeper at that point

### Diminishing MRS
For [[Properties of Well-Behaved Indifference Curves#6. Convex Shape|convex indifference curves]], the MRS is **diminishing** - the absolute value of the MRS decreases as we move along the curve.
