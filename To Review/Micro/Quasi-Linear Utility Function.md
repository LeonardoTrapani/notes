A utility function of the form:

$$u(x_1, x_2) = f(x_1) + x_2$$

is **linear in just $x_2$** and is called **quasi-linear**.

## Example

$$u(x_1, x_2) = 2x_1^{1/2} + x_2$$

## Key Characteristics

### Indifference Curve Properties

Quasi-linear indifference curves have a distinctive property:
- **Each curve is a vertically shifted copy of the others**
- All curves have the same shape
- They differ only by vertical translation

### Mathematical Structure
- The function is **non-linear** in $x_1$ (typically concave)  
- The function is **linear** in $x_2$
- This creates the vertical shifting property

### Marginal Utilities
- $\text{MU}_{x_1} = f'(x_1)$ (depends on $x_1$ level)
- $\text{MU}_{x_2} = 1$ (constant)

### Marginal Rate of Substitution
$$\text{MRS} = -\frac{f'(x_1)}{1} = -f'(x_1)$$

The MRS depends only on the quantity of $x_1$, not on $x_2$.

## Economic Interpretation

### Good 2 as Numeraire
In quasi-linear preferences, good 2 often represents:
- Money or income
- A composite good
- A numeraire commodity

### Income Effects
Quasi-linear preferences have a special property:
- Changes in income affect only consumption of $x_2$
- Demand for $x_1$ depends only on relative prices, not income level
- This simplifies analysis in many economic models

## Applications

Quasi-linear utility functions are commonly used in:
- Public economics (public goods provision)
- Industrial organization (consumer surplus analysis)  
- Auction theory
- Models where one good represents "money left over"

The vertical shifting property makes welfare analysis particularly tractable with quasi-linear preferences.
