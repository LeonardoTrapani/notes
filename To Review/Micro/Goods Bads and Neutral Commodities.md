Commodities can be classified based on how they affect utility when consumption increases.

## Classification

### Good
A **good** is a commodity which **increases utility** with additional consumption.
- Marginal utility is positive: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i} > 0$

### Bad  
A **bad** is a commodity which **decreases utility** with additional consumption.
- Marginal utility is negative: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i} < 0$

### Neutral
A **neutral** is a commodity which **does not change utility** with additional consumption.
- Marginal utility is zero: $\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i} = 0$

## Visual Example: Water Consumption

Screenshot from the resource recommended at page 39

The utility function for water shows how the same commodity can transition between categories:

- **Initial units**: Water acts as a **good** (utility increases)
- **Around saturation point $x'$**: Water becomes **neutral** (utility unchanged) 
- **Excess units**: Water becomes a **bad** (utility decreases)

This illustrates that whether something is a good, bad, or neutral depends on:
1. The current consumption level
2. Individual preferences  
3. Context and circumstances

## Implications for Consumer Choice

Understanding these classifications helps predict:
- How consumers will respond to price changes
- Which direction consumption will move when income changes
- The shape and properties of [[Indifference Curves]]

The classification directly relates to the sign of [[Marginal Utility Definition]] for each commodity.
