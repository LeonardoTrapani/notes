Demand curves can be derived graphically by systematically varying the price of one good while holding the other price and income constant, then tracing the optimal consumption points.

## Graphical Method

### Setup
1. **Fix** income $m$ and price of good 2 $(p_2)$
2. **Vary** the price of good 1 $(p_1)$ 
3. **Trace** the optimal bundles as $p_1$ changes
4. **Plot** the price-quantity relationship

### Budget Line Rotation
As $p_1$ decreases:
- The budget constraint **rotates outward** around the $x_2$-intercept
- The slope $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ becomes less steep
- More of good 1 becomes affordable

### Tracing Optimal Points
Each budget line has a unique optimal point where:
- The budget line is **tangent** to the highest achievable indifference curve
- The [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] equals the price ratio: $MRS = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$

## Price-Consumption Curve

The **price-consumption curve** connects all optimal bundles as one price varies, holding other factors constant.

### Properties
- Shows how optimal quantities of **both** goods change as one price changes
- Provides foundation for deriving individual demand curves
- Shape depends on the underlying [[Utility Function Definition|utility function]]

## Demand Curve Construction

### From Price-Consumption Curve to Demand Curve
1. **Extract** the $(p_1, x_1^*)$ pairs from each optimal bundle
2. **Plot** price on vertical axis, quantity on horizontal axis  
3. **Connect** the points to form the demand curve

### Different Shapes by Preference Type

#### [[Cobb-Douglas Utility Function]]
- **Smooth, downward-sloping** demand curve
- Exhibits typical convex indifference curves
- **Screenshot from the resource recommended at page 55**

#### [[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function]] 
- **Horizontal segment** with vertical drops
- Perfectly elastic at the point where $p_1 = p_2$
- Corner solutions predominate

#### [[Perfect Complements Utility Function]]
- Demand curve depends on **both prices** simultaneously
- Less standard shape due to fixed proportions

## Economic Insights

### Law of Demand
For most preference types, graphical derivation confirms the **law of demand**:
- As price decreases, quantity demanded increases
- Demand curves slope downward

### Income and Substitution Effects
Graphical method reveals how price changes affect:
- **Movement along** indifference curves (substitution)
- **Movement between** indifference curves (income effects)

### Exceptional Cases
Some preference types ([[Goods Bads and Neutral Commodities]], concave preferences) may produce:
- **Vertical** demand curves (perfectly inelastic)
- **Horizontal** segments (perfectly elastic ranges)

## Connection to Analytical Methods

Graphical derivation provides **visual confirmation** of demand functions derived analytically:
- [[Cobb-Douglas Demand Functions]]
- [[Perfect Complements Demand Functions]]  
- [[Perfect Substitutes Demand Functions]]

The graphical approach offers intuition for understanding **why** demand functions take their specific mathematical forms.
