## Violations of Well-Behaved Preferences

### When Preferences Violate Axioms
What happens if an individual's preferences violate one (or more) of the [[Well-Behaved Preferences|axioms]]? **Very interesting things happen!**

### Types of Violations

#### A. Perfect Substitutes
- **Axiom violated**: Strict [[Well-Behaved Preferences#5. Convexity|convexity]]
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Units of commodities 1 and 2 are always regarded as equivalent
  - Only the total amount determines preference rank-order
  - [[Indifference Curves]] are straight lines with constant slope
  - [[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]] is constant

#### B. Perfect Complements  
- **Axiom violated**: [[Well-Behaved Preferences#4. (Strict) Monotonicity|Monotonicity]]
- **Characteristics**:
  - Commodities consumed in fixed proportions (e.g., 1:1, 2:1, 1:7)
  - Only the number of pairs determines preference rank-order  
  - [[Indifference Curves]] are L-shaped
  - [[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]] is zero, infinite, or undefined
  - Due to economist Wassily Leontief (Nobel Prize 1973)

#### C. Concave Indifference Curves
- **Axiom violated**: [[Well-Behaved Preferences#5. Convexity|Convexity]]
- **Characteristics**:
  - Individuals prefer NOT to diversify consumption
  - Linear combinations are less preferred than extreme bundles
  - [[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]] is increasing

#### D. Neutral Goods  
- **Axioms violated**: [[Well-Behaved Preferences#4. (Strict) Monotonicity|Monotonicity]] and [[Well-Behaved Preferences#5. Convexity|Convexity]]
- **Characteristics**:
  - Individual is indifferent to one of the goods
  - [[Indifference Curves]] are horizontal or vertical lines

#### E. "Bads"
- **Axiom violated**: [[Well-Behaved Preferences#4. (Strict) Monotonicity|Monotonicity]] 
- **Examples**: Pollution, garbage, noise
- **Characteristics**:
  - More "bads" is less preferred  
  - [[Indifference Curves]] are positively sloped
  - [[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]] is positive
