If preferences satisfy the five axioms of [[Well-Behaved Preferences]], then indifference curves have six properties:

### 1. Preference Ordering by Distance from Origin
**Bundles on indifference curves farther from the origin are preferred to bundles on indifference curves closer to the origin**

**Axiom**: [[Well-Behaved Preferences#4. (Strict) Monotonicity|Monotonicity axiom]]

### 2. Complete Coverage  
**Every bundle lies on an indifference curve**

**Axiom**: [[Regularity Axioms for Preferences#1. Completeness|Completeness axiom]]

### 3. Non-Crossing Property
**Indifference curves for the same individual cannot cross**

**Axiom**: [[Regularity Axioms for Preferences#3. Transitivity|Transitivity axiom]] + [[Well-Behaved Preferences#4. (Strict) Monotonicity|Monotonicity axiom]]

**Proof by contradiction**: If curves crossed, transitivity would be violated.

### 4. Downward Slope for "Goods"
**Indifference curves slope downward for "goods"**

**Axiom**: [[Well-Behaved Preferences#4. (Strict) Monotonicity|Monotonicity axiom]]

When both commodities are goods, curves must have negative slope.

### 5. Thin Curves
**Indifference curves cannot be thick**

**Axiom**: [[Well-Behaved Preferences#4. (Strict) Monotonicity|Monotonicity axiom]]

### 6. Convex Shape
**Indifference curves are convex**  

**Axiom**: [[Well-Behaved Preferences#5. Convexity|Convexity axiom]]

**Implications**:
- Individuals prefer to diversify their consumption
- Any linear combination of two bundles lying on an IC is preferred to either bundle
- [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] is diminishing
