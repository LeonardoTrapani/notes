## Regularity Axioms for Preferences

### Purpose
To build a model that explains and predicts consumers' choices, economists assume that individual preferences satisfy a minimum set of **regularity assumptions (axioms)**.

### The Three Basic Axioms

#### 1. Completeness ("always have an answer")
For any bundles $a$ and $b$, either $a \succeq b$, or $b \succeq a$, or $a \sim b$

**Meaning**: An individual can always compare any two bundles and express a preference or indifference.

#### 2. Reflexivity (... unless you are a small kid)
Any bundle $a \succeq a$

**Meaning**: An individual considers any bundle to be at least as good as itself.

#### 3. Transitivity ("avoid contradictory answers")
If $b \succeq a$ and $c \succeq b$, then $c \succeq a$

**Meaning**: Preferences are logically consistent - if you prefer A to B and B to C, then you must prefer A to C.

### Mathematical Foundation
These axioms provide the mathematical foundation for representing preferences using [[Indifference Curves]] and utility functions.
