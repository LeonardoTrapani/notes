### Economic Interpretation of Slope
The slope of the [[Budget Constraint Definition|budget constraint]] measures the **opportunity cost** of good $x_1$ with respect to good $x_2$.

### Definition of Opportunity Cost
The opportunity cost of an extra unit of good 1 is $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ units foregone of good 2.

### Mathematical Expression
The slope is: $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$

### Trade-offs
- **To buy one more unit of good 1**: Must give up $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ units of good 2
- **To buy one more unit of good 2**: Must give up $\frac{p_2}{p_1}$ units of good 1

### Key Insight
The slope captures the **relative price** - the price of one commodity in terms of the other commodity.
