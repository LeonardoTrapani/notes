### When Budget Constraints Are Curved
If **prices are constant**, the budget constraint will always be a **straight line**.

When **prices are not constant**, the budget constraint will be **curved**.

### Types of Non-Linear Budget Constraints

#### A. Quantity Discounts
- **Price structure**: Lower price per unit after purchasing a certain quantity
- **Shape**: Budget constraint becomes flatter (less steep) after the discount threshold
- **Example**: $p_1 = 2$ for $0 \leq x_1 \leq 20$ and $p_1 = 1$ for $x_1 > 20$

#### B. Quantity Penalties  
- **Price structure**: Higher price per unit after purchasing a certain quantity
- **Shape**: Budget constraint becomes steeper after the penalty threshold
- **Example**: $p_1 = 1$ for $0 \leq x_1 \leq 20$ and $p_1 = 4$ for $x_1 > 20$

#### C. Taxes and Subsidies
**Study on your own in the textbook, pp. 26-29.**

Key questions:
- Will a given tax (or subsidy) change the slope of the budget constraint?
- Or will the tax (or subsidy) shift the budget constraint parallel?

#### D. Quantity Rationing
**Study on your own the textbook, p. 28.**

#### E. Food Stamps Program
**Study on your own in the textbook, pp. 29-31.**
