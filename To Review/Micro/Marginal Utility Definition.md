**Marginal utility** of $x_i$ is the change in utility an individual gets if they consume one more or one less unit of good $x_i$.

## Mathematical Definition

For discrete changes: $$\text{MU}_{x_i} = \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta x_i}$$

For small (infinitesimal) changes: $$\text{MU}_{x_i} = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i}$$

The marginal utility is the **partial derivative** of the utility function with respect to good $x_i$, representing the slope of the utility function in the direction of that good.

## Relationship to MRS

The [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] can be expressed in terms of marginal utilities:

$$\text{MRS} = -\frac{\text{MU}_{x_1}}{\text{MU}_{x_2}}$$

### Derivation

On the same indifference curve, total utility remains constant:
- Infinitesimal variations in $x_1$ change utility by: $\text{MU}_{x_1} dx_1$
- Infinitesimal variations in $x_2$ change utility by: $\text{MU}_{x_2} dx_2$

For constant utility: $\text{MU}_{x_1} dx_1 = -\text{MU}_{x_2} dx_2$

Rearranging: $\frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = -\frac{\text{MU}_{x_1}}{\text{MU}_{x_2}}$

Since MRS $= \frac{dx_2}{dx_1}$, we obtain: $\text{MRS} = -\frac{\text{MU}_{x_1}}{\text{MU}_{x_2}}$

## Example: Cobb-Douglas Function

For $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 x_2$:
- $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} = x_2$
- $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = x_1$

Therefore: $\text{MRS} = -\frac{x_2}{x_1}$

This shows how marginal utilities provide the foundation for calculating the marginal rate of substitution.
