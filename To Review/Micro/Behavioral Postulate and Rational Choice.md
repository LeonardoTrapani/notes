## Behavioral Postulate in Economics

### Core Definition
A decision maker always chooses his or her **most preferred** alternative from his or her set of **available** alternatives.

### Two-Step Process of Rational Choice

#### Step 1: Identify Feasible Options
Individuals first identify the set of **affordable alternatives** ([[Budget Constraint Definition|budget set]]) among those available.

#### Step 2: Select Optimal Choice  
Given their [[Preference Relations|preferences]], they choose "the best" alternative among those affordable.

### Mathematical Formulation
Economic theory states that individuals choose in a "rational way" by maximizing their well-being subject to scarcity and trade-offs:

$$\max_{x_1,x_2} U(x_1, x_2)$$
$$\text{s.t. } p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$$

### Economic Interpretation
This behavioral assumption underlies all consumer choice theory and provides the foundation for deriving [[Deriving Demand Functions Overview|demand functions]].

### Key Insight
Rationality doesn't mean individuals make "perfect" choices, but rather that they consistently choose their most preferred option from what they can afford.
