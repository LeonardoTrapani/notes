## Demand Curve Characteristics by Preference Type

### Cobb-Douglas Preferences

#### Demand Curve Shape
- **Smooth, downward-sloping curve**
- Hyperbolic shape: $x_1 = \frac{\alpha m}{(a+b)p_1}$
- **Continuous** at all price levels

#### Key Properties
- Quantity approaches infinity as price approaches zero
- Quantity approaches zero as price approaches infinity
- No price at which demand becomes exactly zero

### Perfect Substitutes Preferences  

#### Demand Curve Shape
- **Horizontal line** at price $p_1 = p_2$, then **vertical drop**
- Extremely **discontinuous** at the critical price

#### Key Properties
- When $p_1 < p_2$: $x_1 = m/p_1$ (consume only good 1)
- When $p_1 > p_2$: $x_1 = 0$ (consume only good 2)  
- When $p_1 = p_2$: Any combination on budget constraint acceptable

#### Critical Insight
The demand "curve" is actually two distinct segments with a discontinuous jump between them.

### Perfect Complements Preferences

#### Demand Curve Shape
- **Smooth, downward-sloping curve** 
- Similar to Cobb-Douglas but with different functional form
- Quantity: $x_1 = \frac{m}{p_1 + p_2}$

#### Key Properties
- Demand depends on **sum of both prices** $(p_1 + p_2)$
- Smooth substitution despite fixed proportions consumption
- More gradual response to price changes than Cobb-Douglas

### Neutral Goods (Special Cases)

#### Vertical Indifference Curves (Good 1 Neutral)
- **Perfectly vertical demand curve** at $x_1 = m/p_1$
- Quantity independent of good 1's price
- **Perfectly elastic demand**

#### Horizontal Indifference Curves (Good 2 Neutral)  
- **Perfectly horizontal demand curve** at $x_1 = 0$
- Zero demand regardless of price
- **Perfectly inelastic demand**

### Concave Preferences ("Addiction")

#### Demand Curve Shape
- **Discontinuous** - either full specialization or zero consumption
- Similar to perfect substitutes but based on preference intensity rather than relative prices

#### Key Properties
- Complete corner solutions always
- Demand jumps discontinuously between extremes

### Quasi-Linear Preferences

#### Demand Curve Shape
- **Mixed characteristics**: Smooth interior region, then corner solution
- Smooth downward-sloping portion followed by zero demand

#### Key Properties  
- Interior solution when income sufficiently high
- Corner solution when income constrained
- Transition point depends on income level and preferences

### Graphical Summary

**Smooth Curves**: Cobb-Douglas, Perfect Complements  
**Discontinuous Curves**: Perfect Substitutes, Concave Preferences  
**Mixed**: Quasi-linear (smooth then discontinuous)  
**Extreme Cases**: Neutral goods (vertical or horizontal lines)
