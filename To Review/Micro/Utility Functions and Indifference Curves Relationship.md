[[Indifference Curves]] and [[Utility Function Definition]] are two identical ways of representing individual preferences, both following Vilfredo Pareto's approach (1848-1923).

## Key Relationships

### Equal Preference = Same Utility Level
- An indifference curve contains equally preferred bundles
- Equal preference implies same utility level  
- Therefore, all bundles on an indifference curve have the same utility level

### Indifference Map = Utility Function
The **indifference map** is the collection of all indifference curves for a given preference relation.

**An indifference map is equivalent to a utility function.**

### Preference Ordering and Utility Levels
- Higher indifference curves contain more preferred bundles
- Higher utility levels correspond to higher indifference curves
- The complete collection of indifference curves completely represents the consumer's preferences

## Visualization

The relationship can be visualized in both:
- **2D**: Traditional indifference curve diagram with utility levels labeled
- **3D**: Plotting utility level on vertical axis, with indifference curves as horizontal slices at different heights

### Example with Specific Bundles
Consider bundles $(4,1)$, $(2,3)$, and $(2,2)$ where $(2,3) \succ (4,1) \sim (2,2)$.

Assigning utility levels: $u(2,3) = 6 > u(4,1) = u(2,2) = 4$

This creates:
- Bundles $(4,1)$ and $(2,2)$ on indifference curve with utility level $u = 4$
- Bundle $(2,3)$ on indifference curve with utility level $u = 6$

## Mathematical Equivalence

Both representations provide complete descriptions of consumer preferences and are mathematically equivalent ways to analyze choice behavior.
