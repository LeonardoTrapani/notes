Comprehensive overview of **Chapter 5: Choice** covering constrained optimal choice, interior and corner solutions, and the derivation of demand functions for different preference types.

## Core Concepts

### Constrained Optimization
- [[Constrained Optimal Choice Definition]] - Fundamental concept combining feasibility and optimality
- [[Interior and Corner Solutions]] - Two types of optimal solutions and their conditions

### Solution Methods
- [[Deriving Demand Functions Overview]] - Mathematical foundation for demand function derivation
- [[Graphical Derivation of Demand Curves]] - Visual approach to understanding demand relationships

## Demand Functions by Preference Type

### Always Interior Solutions
- [[Cobb-Douglas Demand Functions]] - Elegant functions depending only on own-price and income
- [[Perfect Complements Demand Functions]] - Fixed proportion consumption with price-sum dependency

### Mixed Interior/Corner Solutions  
- **Quasi-linear preferences** - See September 17 review session R1
- [[Perfect Substitutes Demand Functions]] - Complete specialization based on relative prices

### Always Corner Solutions
- [[Neutral Goods and Concave Preferences Demand]] - Complete specialization due to extreme preferences

## Key Mathematical Relationships

### Optimality Conditions
For **interior solutions** with well-behaved preferences:
$$MRS(x^*) = \frac{p_1}{p_2} \Leftrightarrow \frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2} \Leftrightarrow \frac{MU_{x_1}}{p_1} = \frac{MU_{x_2}}{p_2}$$

For **corner solutions**:
- If $x_1^* > 0, x_2^* = 0$: $MRS(x^*) \geq \frac{p_1}{p_2}$
- If $x_1^* = 0, x_2^* > 0$: $MRS(x^*) \leq \frac{p_1}{p_2}$

### Feasibility Condition (Universal)
$$p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$$

## Economic Intuition

### Tangency Condition
At the optimal interior bundle, the **budget constraint** tells the individual how many units of commodity 2 he/she **must give up** to consume one more unit of commodity 1, while **indifference curves** tell how many units he/she **is willing to give up**.

At the optimum: "how much I MUST trade off" = "how much I WANT to trade off"

### Marginal Utility per Euro
The optimality condition shows that marginal utility per euro spent is equated across commodities: $\frac{MU_{x_1}}{p_1} = \frac{MU_{x_2}}{p_2}$

## Prerequisites
- [[Utility Function Definition]]
- [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] 
- [[Budget Constraint Definition]]
- [[Well-Behaved Preferences]]

## Applications
- Consumer demand analysis
- Market demand construction  
- Policy analysis of price changes
- Understanding consumer substitution patterns
