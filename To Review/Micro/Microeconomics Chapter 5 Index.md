## Key Mathematical Relationships

### Optimality Conditions
For **interior solutions** with well-behaved preferences:
$$MRS(x^*) = \frac{p_1}{p_2} \Leftrightarrow \frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2} \Leftrightarrow \frac{MU_{x_1}}{p_1} = \frac{MU_{x_2}}{p_2}$$

For **corner solutions**:
- If $x_1^* > 0, x_2^* = 0$: $MRS(x^*) \geq \frac{p_1}{p_2}$
- If $x_1^* = 0, x_2^* > 0$: $MRS(x^*) \leq \frac{p_1}{p_2}$

### Feasibility Condition (Universal)
$$p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$$

## Economic Intuition

### Tangency Condition
At the optimal interior bundle, the **budget constraint** tells the individual how many units of commodity 2 he/she **must give up** to consume one more unit of commodity 1, while **indifference curves** tell how many units he/she **is willing to give up**.

At the optimum: "how much I MUST trade off" = "how much I WANT to trade off"

### Marginal Utility per Euro
The optimality condition shows that marginal utility per euro spent is equated across commodities: $\frac{MU_{x_1}}{p_1} = \frac{MU_{x_2}}{p_2}$
