For [[Perfect Complements Utility Function|perfect complements preferences]], consumers always choose goods in fixed proportions, leading to demand functions that depend on the sum of prices.

## Utility Function
$$U(x_1, x_2) = \min(x_1, x_2)$$

This represents goods that must be consumed together in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., left and right shoes).

## Optimality Condition

Since indifference curves have kinks at the 45-degree line, the [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] is undefined at the optimum. Instead, the optimality condition is:

$$x_1^* = x_2^*$$

Consumers want to consume goods in the same proportion because with perfect complements, utility is limited by the good in shorter supply.

## Demand Functions

### For 1:1 Perfect Complements
$$x_1(p_1, p_2, m) = \frac{m}{p_1 + p_2}$$
$$x_2(p_1, p_2, m) = \frac{m}{p_1 + p_2}$$

## Key Properties

### Equal Consumption
At the optimum: $x_1^* = x_2^*$

Both goods are consumed in equal quantities regardless of their relative prices.

### Price Dependency
Unlike [[Cobb-Douglas Demand Functions]], demand depends on **both** prices through their sum $(p_1 + p_2)$.

### Always Interior Solutions
Perfect complements always yield [[Interior and Corner Solutions|interior solutions]] where both $x_1^* > 0$ and $x_2^* > 0$.

### No Substitution
Since goods must be consumed together, there is no substitution between goods when relative prices change.

## Derivation Method

1. **Optimality condition**: $x_1 = x_2$ (consume in equal proportions)
2. **Feasibility condition**: $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$
3. **Substitute**: Since $x_1 = x_2 = x$, we have $p_1x + p_2x = m$
4. **Solve**: $x(p_1 + p_2) = m$, so $x = \frac{m}{p_1 + p_2}$

## Generalization

For perfect complements in ratio $a:b$ with utility $U(x_1, x_2) = \min(\frac{x_1}{a}, \frac{x_2}{b})$:

$$x_1(p_1, p_2, m) = \frac{a \cdot m}{a \cdot p_1 + b \cdot p_2}$$
$$x_2(p_1, p_2, m) = \frac{b \cdot m}{a \cdot p_1 + b \cdot p_2}$$
