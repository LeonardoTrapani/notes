### Definition
In the real world, individuals choose/demand/consume bundles of commodities.

Mathematically, a **consumption bundle**, $x$, is a vector where $x_i$ indicates the units of good $i$ an individual chooses/consumes:

$$x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n)$$

### Two-Good Simplification
To use graphs, we assume that individuals choose/demand/consume just **two commodities**: $x_1$ and $x_2$.

**Important**: What we learn using two goods can be extended to $n$ goods.

### Mathematical Representation
For two goods, a bundle is represented as:
- Bundle $A = (x_1^A, x_2^A)$
- Bundle $B = (x_1^B, x_2^B)$
