**Demand functions** express the optimal quantities demanded as functions of prices and income, derived from solving the consumer's constrained optimization problem.

## Definition

Demand functions express the quantities demanded in terms of the prices of both commodities and income:
- $x_1(p_1, p_2, m)$ - demand for good 1
- $x_2(p_1, p_2, m)$ - demand for good 2

These functions tell us the quantities demanded by the individual for any prices and incomes **such that these quantities maximize his/her utility subject to the budget constraint**.

## Mathematical Foundation

The demand functions result from solving the constrained optimization problem:
$$\max_{x_1,x_2} U(x_1, x_2)$$
$$\text{subject to } p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$$

## Solution Method

For preferences that satisfy the 5 axioms ([[Well-Behaved Preferences]]), the optimal bundles are found by solving a system of two equations:

1. **Optimality condition**: $MRS = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$ which can be written as $\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$
2. **Feasibility condition**: $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$

Taking prices and income as given, we solve for the two unknown variables $x_1$ and $x_2$.

## Types of Demand Functions by Preference Type

### Well-Behaved Preferences
- **[[Cobb-Douglas Utility Function]]**: Always [[Interior and Corner Solutions|interior solutions]] with simple demand functions
- **[[Perfect Complements Utility Function]]**: Always interior solutions with equal consumption ratios

### Non-Standard Preferences  
- **[[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function]]**: Corner solutions or indifferent combinations depending on price ratios
- **[[Quasi-Linear Utility Function]]**: Mixed interior and corner solutions
- **[[Goods Bads and Neutral Commodities]]**: Always corner solutions
- **Concave preferences**: Always corner solutions (addiction behavior)

## Marshallian Demand Functions

The demand functions derived from utility maximization are called **Marshallian demand functions** or **direct demand functions**, distinguishing them from other types of demand functions in consumer theory.
