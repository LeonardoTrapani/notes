### Definition
In market economies, goods and services are allocated through the **market mechanism**.

### Two Sides of a Market
- **[[Demand]]**
- **[[Supply]]**

When markets work, prices measure the **scarcity** of the goods and services that are exchanged. 

Prices convey critical information to buyers and sellers who make their decisions based on prices (and other variables).
