Consider the utility function:

$$V(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$$

This utility function represents two goods that are **perfect substitutes**.

## Indifference Curve Properties

Perfect substitutes have distinctive indifference curves:
- **All are linear and parallel**
- **Constant slope** of -1 (in this example)
- **No curvature** - straight lines throughout

### Examples of Indifference Curves
- $x_1 + x_2 = 5$ (lower utility level)
- $x_1 + x_2 = 9$ (medium utility level)  
- $x_1 + x_2 = 13$ (higher utility level)

## Mathematical Properties

### Marginal Utilities
- $\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_1} = 1$
- $\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_2} = 1$

### Marginal Rate of Substitution
$$\text{MRS} = -\frac{1}{1} = -1$$

The MRS is **constant** along all indifference curves and between all bundles.

## Economic Interpretation

### Perfect Substitutability
- Consumer is **always willing to trade** one unit of $x_1$ for one unit of $x_2$
- **Indifferent** between having $(5,0)$ or $(0,5)$ or $(2.5, 2.5)$ - all give same utility
- The **rate of substitution never changes** regardless of current consumption levels

### General Form
More generally: $V(x_1, x_2) = ax_1 + bx_2$ where the MRS $= -\frac{a}{b}$ (constant).

## Examples in Real Life
- Different brands of identical products (e.g., generic vs. brand-name medications)
- Different denominations of currency ($1 bill vs. 4 quarters)
- Commodities that serve identical functions

## Implications for Consumer Choice
With perfect substitutes:
- Consumer will typically choose **corner solutions**
- Will consume only the cheaper good (unless prices are proportional to coefficients)
- **No interior solutions** unless price ratio exactly equals MRS

This extreme case contrasts sharply with [[Cobb-Douglas Utility Function]] where some of both goods are typically consumed.
