Information on individuals' preferences can be **ordinal** or **cardinal**.

## Ordinal Utility

**Ordinal information** only tells us **if** one alternative is better or worse than another.

Following Pareto's approach, utility is an **ordinal** (i.e., ordering) concept. The scale chosen for the utility function is arbitrary and does not change the underlying preferences.

### Example
If $u(a) = 6$ and $u(b) = 2$, then bundle $a$ is strictly preferred to bundle $b$. However, $a$ is **not** preferred three times as much as $b$! The numerical values only indicate ranking, not intensity of preference.

## Cardinal Utility

**Cardinal information** tells us **how much** better or worse one alternative is with respect to another.

## Key Principle

We assume that [[Utility Function Definition]] summarize **ordinal information**:
- The scale we choose for the utility function is arbitrary
- It does not change the underlying preferences
- Only the ordering matters, not the specific numerical values

## Implications

This ordinal nature means that any [[Monotonic Transformation of Utility Functions]] that preserves order will represent the same preferences.
