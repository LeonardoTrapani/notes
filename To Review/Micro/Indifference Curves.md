### Definition
Given bundle $a = (x_1^a, x_2^a)$, **indifference curve** $I$ is the set of bundles $(x_1, x_2)$ which the individual considers as good as bundle $a$:

$$I = \{(x_1, x_2) | (x_1, x_2) \sim a\}$$

The individual is "indifferent" in the sense that he/she is willing to exchange them and be equally "happy."

### Representation Approaches
**Great and rigorous treatment of this topic in your Math book, Sections 6.2, 6.8 and 22.1.4**

Two ways of representing individual preferences:
- **[[Indifference Curves]]** (approach due to Vilfredo Pareto, 1848-1923)
- **Utility functions** ($U$)

### Indifference Map
An **indifference map** consists of multiple indifference curves, where curves farther from the origin represent higher levels of preference.

### Function of Indifference Curves
An indifference curve divides all bundles into three groups:
1. **Bundles above the curve**: Strictly preferred
2. **Bundles on the curve**: Indifferent  
3. **Bundles below the curve**: Less preferred
