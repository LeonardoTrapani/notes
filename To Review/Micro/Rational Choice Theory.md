## Rational Choice Theory

### Behavioral Postulate
**Rational choice theory** assumes that individuals choose in a "rational way" - they maximize their well-being subject to scarcity and trade-offs.

### Two-Step Process
1. **First**, they identify the set of feasible alternatives
2. **Next**, they choose "the best" alternative among those feasible

### Core Assumption
A decision maker always chooses his or her **most preferred** alternative from his or her set of **available** alternatives.

### Implication
To understand and model choice, we must model the decision maker's **[[Preferences]]**.

### Determinants of Demand
What determines what and how much I demand?

- **[[Budget Constraint]]** (prices of goods & services + income) → determines what I **CAN** purchase
- **[[Preferences]]** (tastes) → determine what I **WANT** to purchase
