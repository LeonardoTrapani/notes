## Optimality Conditions for Corner Solutions

### Definition of Corner Solution
An optimal bundle $x^* = (x_1^*, x_2^*)$ is a **corner solution** if the individual chooses only one of the two goods:

**Case 1:** $x_1^* > 0$ and $x_2^* = 0$
**Case 2:** $x_1^* = 0$ and $x_2^* > 0$

### Required Conditions

#### Feasibility Condition (Universal)
$$p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$$

#### Optimality Conditions

**For Case 1** ($x_1^* > 0, x_2^* = 0$):
$$MRS(x^*) \geq \frac{p_1}{p_2}$$

**For Case 2** ($x_1^* = 0, x_2^* > 0$):  
$$MRS(x^*) \leq \frac{p_1}{p_2}$$

### Economic Interpretation

#### Case 1: Only Good 1 Consumed
The individual's willingness to trade off good 2 for good 1 ([[Marginal Rate of Substitution|MRS]]) is **greater than or equal to** the market trade-off rate. Even at the corner, they wouldn't want to consume any of good 2.

#### Case 2: Only Good 2 Consumed  
The individual's willingness to trade off good 2 for good 1 is **less than or equal to** the market rate. They prefer to specialize completely in good 2.

### Examples by Preference Type

#### Always Corner Solutions
- **[[Neutral Goods and Concave Preferences Demand|Neutral goods]]**: Complete specialization in the preferred good
- **Concave preferences ("addiction")**: Complete specialization due to extreme preferences

#### Sometimes Corner Solutions
- **[[Perfect Substitutes Demand Functions|Perfect substitutes]]**: Corner solution when goods have different prices
- **[[Quasi-Linear Utility Function|Quasi-linear preferences]]**: Corner solution when income is low relative to prices

### Key Difference from Interior Solutions
Unlike [[Optimality Conditions for Interior Solutions|interior solutions]], corner solutions do **not** require the tangency condition $MRS = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$ to hold exactly.

### Graphical Understanding
At corner solutions, the highest achievable indifference curve touches the budget constraint at an endpoint rather than being tangent to it in the interior.
