**Utility** refers to a set of numerical values that reflect the relative rankings of various bundles of goods.

The **utility function** is the relationship between utility measures and every possible bundle of goods. It provides a mathematical way to represent consumer preferences.

## Formal Definition

A utility function $u(x)$ represents a preference relation if and only if:
- $a \geq b \Leftrightarrow u(a) \geq u(b)$
- $a \succ b \Leftrightarrow u(a) > u(b)$  
- $a \sim b \Leftrightarrow u(a) = u(b)$

## Key Properties

- Any preference relation that is complete, reflexive, and transitive can be represented by a utility function
- Given a specific utility function, you can graph specific [[Indifference Curves]] and determine exactly how much utility is gained from specific consumption choices
- The utility function allows comparison and ranking of infinite consumption bundles on the real plane

## Relationship to Preferences

Utility functions provide a solution to the problem of comparing infinite bundles and choosing "the best alternative" among available options. They offer a more efficient approach than computing the [[Marginal Rate of Substitution]] for each indifference curve at each bundle.
