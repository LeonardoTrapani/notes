For [[Perfect Substitutes Utility Function|perfect substitutes preferences]], consumers view goods as completely interchangeable, leading to demand functions that depend entirely on which good is relatively cheaper.

## Utility Function
$$U(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$$

This represents goods that are perfect substitutes in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., two brands of identical products).

## Marginal Rate of Substitution
For perfect substitutes: $MRS = \frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$

The consumer is always willing to exchange 1 unit of good 2 for 1 unit of good 1.

## Demand Functions

The demand depends entirely on the comparison between $MRS = 1$ and the price ratio $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$:

### Case 1: $MRS > \frac{p_1}{p_2}$ (Good 1 is relatively cheaper)
$$x_1^* = \frac{m}{p_1}, \quad x_2^* = 0$$

### Case 2: $MRS < \frac{p_1}{p_2}$ (Good 2 is relatively cheaper)  
$$x_1^* = 0, \quad x_2^* = \frac{m}{p_2}$$

### Case 3: $MRS = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$ (Goods have same relative value)
Any combination satisfying: $p_1x_1^* + p_2x_2^* = m$

## Economic Interpretation

### Complete Specialization
Consumers spend all income on whichever good provides better value (lower price per unit of utility).

### Corner Solutions Typical
Perfect substitutes typically lead to [[Interior and Corner Solutions|corner solutions]] where only one good is consumed.

### Price Sensitivity
Demand is extremely sensitive to relative prices - small price changes can cause complete switching between goods.

## Demand Curve Shape

Perfect substitutes generate **horizontal segments** in the demand curve:
- Demand is perfectly elastic at $p_1 = p_2$ 
- Vertical drops occur when relative prices change

## General Form for Substitutes $ax_1 + bx_2$

For utility $U(x_1, x_2) = ax_1 + bx_2$, the MRS = $\frac{a}{b}$:

### If $\frac{a}{b} > \frac{p_1}{p_2}$:
$$x_1^* = \frac{m}{p_1}, \quad x_2^* = 0$$

### If $\frac{a}{b} < \frac{p_1}{p_2}$:
$$x_1^* = 0, \quad x_2^* = \frac{m}{p_2}$$

### If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$:
Any combination on the budget line.

## Key Contrast

Unlike [[Cobb-Douglas Demand Functions]] or [[Perfect Complements Demand Functions]], perfect substitutes lead to:
- **Extreme** price sensitivity  
- **Corner solutions** in most cases
- **Complete specialization** in consumption
