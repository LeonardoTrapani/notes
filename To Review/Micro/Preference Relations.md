### Purpose
To explain consumer behavior, economists assume that consumers have a set of **tastes/preferences** that they use to guide them in choosing among commodities.

### Ranking System
Goods are ranked according to how much **pleasure (utility)** a consumer gets from consuming each good.

### Three Types of Preference Relations

#### Strict Preference ($\succ$)
A consumer strictly prefers bundle $a = (x_1^a, x_2^a)$ to bundle $b = (x_1^b, x_2^b)$

#### Indifference ($\sim$)
A consumer is indifferent between bundles $a$ and $b$

#### Weak Preference ($\succeq$)  
A consumer either prefers $a$ to $b$, or is indifferent between $a$ and $b$

### Source of Preferences
**Where do preferences (tastes) come from?**

In most economic models and applications, economists take **preferences as given** and do not discuss/value/judge an individual's preferences (*de gustibus non disputandum est*).

This is a complicated issue at the crossroad of several disciplines that you will see in advanced courses.
