Certain preference types always result in [[Interior and Corner Solutions|corner solutions]] where consumers specialize completely in one good, regardless of the specific prices and income levels.

## Neutral Goods

**Neutral goods** are commodities toward which the consumer is indifferent - they provide no additional utility.

### Indifference Curve Shapes
- **Vertical indifference curves**: Good 2 is neutral (consumer only cares about good 1)
- **Horizontal indifference curves**: Good 1 is neutral (consumer only cares about good 2)

### Demand Functions for Neutral Goods

#### Case 1: Vertical Indifference Curves ($MRS(x^*) = \infty$)
Consumer only values good 1:
$$x_1^* = \frac{m}{p_1}, \quad x_2^* = 0$$

#### Case 2: Horizontal Indifference Curves ($MRS(x^*) = 0$)  
Consumer only values good 2:
$$x_1^* = 0, \quad x_2^* = \frac{m}{p_2}$$

## Concave Preferences ("Addiction" Behavior)

**Concave preferences** violate the convexity assumption of [[Well-Behaved Preferences]], representing "addiction" or extreme preference for variety.

### Characteristics
- Indifference curves are **concave** to the origin
- The optimal bundle is always at a corner of the budget set
- Consumer prefers to specialize completely rather than consume variety

### Demand Functions for Concave Preferences

The optimal choice depends on which corner provides higher utility:

#### If $MRS(x^*) > \frac{p_1}{p_2}$:
Consumer specializes in good 1:
$$x_1^* = \frac{m}{p_1}, \quad x_2^* = 0$$

#### If $MRS(x^*) < \frac{p_1}{p_2}$:
Consumer specializes in good 2:
$$x_1^* = 0, \quad x_2^* = \frac{m}{p_2}$$

## Economic Interpretation

### No Interior Solutions
Both neutral goods and concave preferences lead to **complete specialization** - consumers never choose interior solutions with positive amounts of both goods.

### Extreme Behavior
- **Neutral goods**: Complete indifference toward one commodity
- **Concave preferences**: Extreme preference for specialization over variety

### Policy Implications
These preferences represent limiting cases that can inform policy decisions about:
- Addiction treatment (concave preferences)
- Goods that provide no utility (neutral goods)

## Contrast with Standard Preferences

Unlike [[Cobb-Douglas Demand Functions]] or [[Perfect Complements Demand Functions]]:
- No **diversification** in consumption
- No **interior solutions**
- Complete **price insensitivity** within broad ranges
